The Ultimate Guide to Local Breakfast in Singapore 


Posted on 10 June, 2015 | By Liyana Meer

Post Category - EatEat - Post Category - Eating OutEating Out  

 


 
Post Category - EatEat - Post Category - Eating OutEating Out 
Your mama was right: breakfast IS the most important meal of the day. Not only does it get your metabolism going, but it can also give you a serious boost to carry you right through your crazy mornings. The Americans have their Eggs Benedict, the Parisians their baguette; we Asians have our own signature morning meals, too. From Nasi Lemak, to Roti Prata and Kaya Toast, here’s a list of our favourite spots for some good ol’ breakfast fit for champions, served up local style. These delish treats are bound to start any day on the right foot. Dig in!

Chin Mee Chin Confectionery for Kaya Toast
To any old passerby, the powder blue exterior, tiled walls and rickety wooden chairs are just regular parts and furnishings of an old bakery. But to those in the know, this nostalgic East Coast bakery has been an institution for generations of families to get their dose of coffee and fluffy kaya buns. All the bakes, pastries and kaya at Chin Mee Chin are made in-house; as soon as you get within five metres of CMC, the waft of delicious kaya greets you. Order their signature buns, slightly toasted with a nice dollop of butter with black coffee, and find a cosy spot to relish your simple, quintessentially Singaporean breakfast.
 Chin Mee Chin Confectionery, 204 East Coast Road, Singapore 428903, (+65) 6354 0419

Selera Rasa for Nasi Lemak
Nasi Lemak is like the Asian version of Bacon and Eggs. There are carbohydrates, protein and the works all loaded onto a plate to give you that morning boost to get through the first part of your day. A set comes served with fragrant coconut rice, a crispy chicken wing or fish, an egg, some cucumber and peanuts with a dollop of sambal; there are many strong contenders for cooking up a mean Nasi Lemak but our money is on Selera Rasa’s iteration at Adam Road. Using Basmati Rice (not many places use Basmati Rice for Nasi Lemak), the light texture and flavour of coconut is enhanced, and when paired with their homemade sambal and sambal cuttlefish (optional) – it’s super shiok! We even heard from a little bird that the Sultan of Brunei loves the Nasi Lemak here. Well, if Selera Rasa’s Nasi Lemak is good enough for royalty, it sure is good enough for us, too!
Selera Rasa, 2 Adam Road, Singapore 289876, (+65) 9843 4509, www.selerarasa.com

Sin Ming Roti Prata for Roti Prata
Perhaps one of the most versatile recipes around, Roti Prata (Roti means bread and prata means flat) is an Indian bread that’s tossed around (no kidding!) and cooked over a flat grill. Inexpensive, fuss-free and delicious, Roti Prata is best served with a side of fish curry but also works well with other dips such as chicken curry or sugar, and even tastes amazing on its own. Because the dough of the Roti Prata at Sin Ming is made in-house, the texture of the bread is soft on the inside and crispy on the outside and is not overly oily. Order a glass of teh tarik (pulled tea) to complete your meal!
Sin Ming Roti Prata, Blk 24, #01-51 Sin Ming Road, Singapore 570024, (+65) 6453 3893

Rochor Original Beancurd for Youtiao and Soya Bean
Warm your tummies with some hot soya bean milk and dunk that crispy youtiao into your soy pudding while you’re at it! That’s how we like our youtiao and soy bean drink and pudding! The beancurd is fresh and its texture is very creamy and smooth, and you can choose to have it warm or cold with your preferred dose of sugar syrup. The youtiao (flour frittter), on the other hand, is a tasty treat on its own. While it seems like the perfect accompaniment to your drink, do give the other fried dough-y items a try, like butterfly buns or egg tarts.
Rochor Original Beancurd, 2 Short Street, Singapore 188211, (+65) 6741 7358, www.facebook.com/pages/Rochor-Original-Beancurd

Bedok Shui Guo for Chwee Kwai
Another popular staple among Singaporeans is chwee kwai; rice cakes topped off with fried radish. A must-eat for people who dine at Bedok Interchange’s hawker centre, Bedok Shui Guo is known to serve one of the cheapest-priced chwee kwai‘s in Singers and is dubbed to be the best in the east with its uber soft rice cakes. The friendly store owners cook up a mean fried radish and are happy to oblige your request for more chye poh, despite its low price.
Bedok Shui Guo, Blk 207, New Upper Changi Road, #01-53, Singapore 460207

Fhoul Madinah Istimewa for Kacang Pool
A simple Mediterranean stew, kacang pool is made from boiled broad beans — and that’s it! Topped off with a runny egg sunny side up, green chillies and diced onions, the homemade recipe hailing from Hadramaut is Fhoul Madinah Istimewa’s specialty as they literally only serve fhoul, fhoul and more fhoul. Tuck into your warm plate of kacang pool with a slice of baguette and smear your bread with the beans. The hint of green chillies and onions will remind you of tangy mexican salsa.
Fhoul Madinah Istimewa, 1 Geylang Serai, #02-114, Singapore 402001

Chey Sua Carrot Cake for Fried Carrot Cake
Famously known as one of the best carrot cake stalls in Singapore, Chey Sua Carrot Cake has even been invited to Sydney for Singapore Day! The humble carrot cake dish is essentially fried rice cake with black sauce (optional), plus radishes and egg. The version at Chey Sua is made up of tiny pieces of rice cakes in small aluminium bowls, fried to perfection with dried turnips on the side.
Chey Sua Carrot Cake, Blk 127, Toa Payoh Food Centre, #02-30, Singapore 311125, (+65) 9816 9412

Anandha Bhavan for Thosai
Thosai is the pretty sister of roti prata. Beneath her thin veneer of tanned crispy skin lies a generous mixture of ground lentils and rice flour. As the oldest Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore, Anandha Bhavan is the spot to hit for this South Indian and Sri Lankan dish. The pastry is crispy and soft at the same time, and rolled into a delicate and delicious map. Served with three dipping sauces: chilli, coconut chutney and sambar, the thosai is an understated beauty that delights many.
Anandha Bhavan, 95 Syed Alwi Road, Singapore 207671, www.anandabhavan.com

No Name Teh Sarabat Stall for Teh Tarik & Roti Kahwin
Yes, this stall literally has no name but it’s a favourite spot of many who love teh tarik (pulled tea with milk) and roti kahwin. The hole-in-the-wall stall is hard to miss in the busy area of Kampung Glam with its blue exterior, not to mention its iconic elderly owner with his long white beard. Roti Kahwin is literally translated to ‘Marriage Bread’, which is essentially a combination of two slices of bread that sandwiches kaya and butter. A taste of the hot piping tea and bread for breakfast is all that one needs in the morning. Comfort food at its best!
No Name Teh Sarabat Stall, 21 Baghdad Street, Singapore 199660

Home-Make Pau Specialist for Buns
Steamed buns and pastries for breakfast? Yes, please! Home-Make Pau Specialist makes adorable and tasty bite-sized buns that are great if you’re in a hurry and need to just grab a little something on the go. Classic favourites are the barbecued pork, lotus paste and red bean paste. There are also mini coffee buns for those who can’t live without their coffee! Other dishes that get the love here are the siew mai, lor mai kai (glutinous rice with chicken) and fan choy (rice with meat and vegetables).
Home-Make Pau Specialist, 34 Cassia Crescent, #01-86, Singapore 390034, (+65) 8115 2747

The hole-in-the-wall stall is hard to miss in the busy area of Kampung Glam with its blue exterior, not to mention its iconic elderly owner with his long white beard. Roti Kahwin is literally translated to ‘Marriage Bread’, which is essentially a combination of two slices of bread that sandwiches kaya and butter. A taste of the hot piping tea and bread for breakfast is all that one needs in the morning. Comfort food at its best!
No Name Teh Sarabat Stall, 21 Baghdad Street, Singapore 199660

Home-Make Pau Specialist for Buns
Steamed buns and pastries for breakfast? Yes, please! Home-Make Pau Specialist makes adorable and tasty bite-sized buns that are great if you’re in a hurry and need to just grab a little something on the go. Classic favourites are the barbecued pork, lotus paste and red bean paste. There are also mini coffee buns for those who can’t live without their coffee! Other dishes that get the love here are the siew mai, lor mai kai (glutinous rice with chicken) and fan choy (rice with meat and vegetables).
Home-Make Pau Specialist, 34 Cassia Crescent, #01-86, Singapore 390034, (+65) 8115 2747
Once you’ve made it to these iconic Singapore eating spots, mama, make sure to commemorate your meal and give us a shoutout on @Instagram with the hashtag #SassyMamaEats!

The Ultimate Guide to Local Breakfast in Singapore

Your mama was right: breakfast IS the most important meal of the day.

Chin Mee Chin Confectionery for Kaya Toast
To any old passerby, the powder blue exterior, tiled walls and rickety wooden chairs are just regular parts and furnishings of an old bakery. But to those in the know, this nostalgic East Coast bakery has been an institution for generations of families to get their dose of coffee and fluffy kaya buns. All the bakes, pastries and kaya at Chin Mee Chin are made in-house; as soon as you get within five metres of CMC, the waft of delicious kaya greets you. Order their signature buns, slightly toasted with a nice dollop of butter with black coffee, and find a cosy spot to relish your simple, quintessentially Singaporean breakfast.
 Chin Mee Chin Confectionery, 204 East Coast Road, Singapore 428903, (+65) 6354 0419

Selera Rasa for Nasi Lemak
Nasi Lemak is like the Asian version of Bacon and Eggs. There are carbohydrates, protein and the works all loaded onto a plate to give you that morning boost to get through the first part of your day. A set comes served with fragrant coconut rice, a crispy chicken wing or fish, an egg, some cucumber and peanuts with a dollop of sambal; there are many strong contenders for cooking up a mean Nasi Lemak but our money is on Selera Rasa’s iteration at Adam Road. Using Basmati Rice (not many places use Basmati Rice for Nasi Lemak), the light texture and flavour of coconut is enhanced, and when paired with their homemade sambal and sambal cuttlefish (optional) – it’s super shiok! We even heard from a little bird that the Sultan of Brunei loves the Nasi Lemak here. Well, if Selera Rasa’s Nasi Lemak is good enough for royalty, it sure is good enough for us, too!

Sin Ming Roti Prata for Roti Prata
Perhaps one of the most versatile recipes around, Roti Prata (Roti means bread and prata means flat) is an Indian bread that’s tossed around (no kidding!) and cooked over a flat grill. Inexpensive, fuss-free and delicious, Roti Prata is best served with a side of fish curry but also works well with other dips such as chicken curry or sugar, and even tastes amazing on its own. Because the dough of the Roti Prata at Sin Ming is made in-house, the texture of the bread is soft on the inside and crispy on the outside and is not overly oily. Order a glass of teh tarik (pulled tea) to complete your meal!

Another popular staple among Singaporeans is chwee kwai; rice cakes topped off with fried radish. A must-eat for people who dine at Bedok Interchange’s hawker centre, Bedok Shui Guo is known to serve one of the cheapest-priced chwee kwai‘s in Singers and is dubbed to be the best in the east with its uber soft rice cakes.

Fhoul Madinah Istimewa for Kacang Pool
A simple Mediterranean stew, kacang pool is made from boiled broad beans — and that’s it! Topped off with a runny egg sunny side up, green chillies and diced onions, the homemade recipe hailing from Hadramaut is Fhoul Madinah Istimewa’s specialty as they literally only serve fhoul, fhoul and more fhoul. Tuck into your warm plate of kacang pool with a slice of baguette and smear your bread with the beans. The hint of green chillies and onions will remind you of tangy mexican salsa.

Anandha Bhavan for Thosai
Thosai is the pretty sister of roti prata. Beneath her thin veneer of tanned crispy skin lies a generous mixture of ground lentils and rice flour. As the oldest Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore, Anandha Bhavan is the spot to hit for this South Indian and Sri Lankan dish. The pastry is crispy and soft at the same time, and rolled into a delicate and delicious map. Served with three dipping sauces: chilli, coconut chutney and sambar, the thosai is an understated beauty that delights many.
Anandha Bhavan, 95 Syed Alwi Road, Singapore 207671, www.anandabhavan.com

No Name Teh Sarabat Stall for Teh Tarik & Roti Kahwin
Yes, this stall literally has no name but it’s a favourite spot of many who love teh tarik (pulled tea with milk) and roti kahwin. The hole-in-the-wall stall is hard to miss in the busy area of Kampung Glam with its blue exterior, not to mention its iconic elderly owner with his long white beard. Roti Kahwin is literally translated to ‘Marriage Bread’, which is essentially a combination of two slices of bread that sandwiches kaya and butter. A taste of the hot piping tea and bread for breakfast is all that one needs in the morning. Comfort food at its best!
No Name Teh Sarabat Stall, 21 Baghdad Street, Singapore 199660

Home-Make Pau Specialist for Buns
Steamed buns and pastries for breakfast? Yes, please! Home-Make Pau Specialist makes adorable and tasty bite-sized buns that are great if you’re in a hurry and need to just grab a little something on the go. Classic favourites are the barbecued pork, lotus paste and red bean paste. There are also mini coffee buns for those who can’t live without their coffee! Other dishes that get the love here are the siew mai, lor mai kai (glutinous rice with chicken) and fan choy (rice with meat and vegetables).
Home-Make Pau Specialist, 34 Cassia Crescent, #01-86, Singapore 390034, (+65) 8115 2747

Your mama was right: breakfast IS the most important meal of the day. Not only does it get your metabolism going, but it can also give you a serious boost to carry you right through your crazy mornings. The Americans have their Eggs Benedict, the Parisians their baguette; we Asians have our own signature morning meals, too. From Nasi Lemak, to Roti Prata and Kaya Toast, here’s a list of our favourite spots for some good ol’ breakfast fit for champions, served up local style. These delish treats are bound to start any day on the right foot. Dig in!

Chin Mee Chin Confectionery for Kaya Toast
To any old passerby, the powder blue exterior, tiled walls and rickety wooden chairs are just regular parts and furnishings of an old bakery. But to those in the know, this nostalgic East Coast bakery has been an institution for generations of families to get their dose of coffee and fluffy kaya buns. All the bakes, pastries and kaya at Chin Mee Chin are made in-house; as soon as you get within five metres of CMC, the waft of delicious kaya greets you. Order their signature buns, slightly toasted with a nice dollop of butter with black coffee, and find a cosy spot to relish your simple, quintessentially Singaporean breakfast.
 Chin Mee Chin Confectionery, 204 East Coast Road, Singapore 428903, (+65) 6354 0419

Selera Rasa for Nasi Lemak
Nasi Lemak is like the Asian version of Bacon and Eggs. There are carbohydrates, protein and the works all loaded onto a plate to give you that morning boost to get through the first part of your day. A set comes served with fragrant coconut rice, a crispy chicken wing or fish, an egg, some cucumber and peanuts with a dollop of sambal; there are many strong contenders for cooking up a mean Nasi Lemak but our money is on Selera Rasa’s iteration at Adam Road. Using Basmati Rice (not many places use Basmati Rice for Nasi Lemak), the light texture and flavour of coconut is enhanced, and when paired with their homemade sambal and sambal cuttlefish (optional) – it’s super shiok! We even heard from a little bird that the Sultan of Brunei loves the Nasi Lemak here. Well, if Selera Rasa’s Nasi Lemak is good enough for royalty, it sure is good enough for us, too!
Selera Rasa, 2 Adam Road, Singapore 289876, (+65) 9843 4509, www.selerarasa.com

Sin Ming Roti Prata for Roti Prata
Perhaps one of the most versatile recipes around, Roti Prata (Roti means bread and prata means flat) is an Indian bread that’s tossed around (no kidding!) and cooked over a flat grill. Inexpensive, fuss-free and delicious, Roti Prata is best served with a side of fish curry but also works well with other dips such as chicken curry or sugar, and even tastes amazing on its own. Because the dough of the Roti Prata at Sin Ming is made in-house, the texture of the bread is soft on the inside and crispy on the outside and is not overly oily. Order a glass of teh tarik (pulled tea) to complete your meal!
Sin Ming Roti Prata, Blk 24, #01-51 Sin Ming Road, Singapore 570024, (+65) 6453 3893

Warm your tummies with some hot soya bean milk and dunk that crispy youtiao into your soy pudding while you’re at it! That’s how we like our youtiao and soy bean drink and pudding! The beancurd is fresh and its texture is very creamy and smooth, and you can choose to have it warm or cold with your preferred dose of sugar syrup. The youtiao (flour frittter), on the other hand, is a tasty treat on its own. While it seems like the perfect accompaniment to your drink, do give the other fried dough-y items a try, like butterfly buns or egg tarts.

Bedok Shui Guo for Chwee Kwai
Another popular staple among Singaporeans is chwee kwai; rice cakes topped off with fried radish. A must-eat for people who dine at Bedok Interchange’s hawker centre, Bedok Shui Guo is known to serve one of the cheapest-priced chwee kwai‘s in Singers and is dubbed to be the best in the east with its uber soft rice cakes.

Fhoul Madinah Istimewa for Kacang Pool
A simple Mediterranean stew, kacang pool is made from boiled broad beans — and that’s it! Topped off with a runny egg sunny side up, green chillies and diced onions, the homemade recipe hailing from Hadramaut is Fhoul Madinah Istimewa’s specialty as they literally only serve fhoul, fhoul and more fhoul. Tuck into your warm plate of kacang pool with a slice of baguette and smear your bread with the beans. The hint of green chillies and onions will remind you of tangy mexican salsa.

The humble carrot cake dish is essentially fried rice cake with black sauce (optional), plus radishes and egg.

Chey Sua Carrot Cake, Blk 127, Toa Payoh Food Centre, #02-30, Singapore 311125, (+65) 9816 9412

Anandha Bhavan for Thosai
Thosai is the pretty sister of roti prata. Beneath her thin veneer of tanned crispy skin lies a generous mixture of ground lentils and rice flour. As the oldest Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore, Anandha Bhavan is the spot to hit for this South Indian and Sri Lankan dish. The pastry is crispy and soft at the same time, and rolled into a delicate and delicious map. Served with three dipping sauces: chilli, coconut chutney and sambar, the thosai is an understated beauty that delights many.

Yes, this stall literally has no name but it’s a favourite spot of many who love teh tarik (pulled tea with milk) and roti kahwin. The hole-in-the-wall stall is hard to miss in the busy area of Kampung Glam with its blue exterior, not to mention its iconic elderly owner with his long white beard. Roti Kahwin is literally translated to ‘Marriage Bread’, which is essentially a combination of two slices of bread that sandwiches kaya and butter. A taste of the hot piping tea and bread for breakfast is all that one needs in the morning. Comfort food at its best!
No Name Teh Sarabat Stall, 21 Baghdad Street, Singapore 199660

Home-Make Pau Specialist for Buns
Steamed buns and pastries for breakfast? Yes, please! Home-Make Pau Specialist makes adorable and tasty bite-sized buns that are great if you’re in a hurry and need to just grab a little something on the go. Classic favourites are the barbecued pork, lotus paste and red bean paste. There are also mini coffee buns for those who can’t live without their coffee! Other dishes that get the love here are the siew mai, lor mai kai (glutinous rice with chicken) and fan choy (rice with meat and vegetables).
Home-Make Pau Specialist, 34 Cassia Crescent, #01-86, Singapore 390034, (+65) 8115 2747

The Ultimate Guide to Local Breakfast in Singapore

Your mama was right: breakfast IS the most important meal of the day. Not only does it get your metabolism going, but it can also give you a serious boost to carry you right through your crazy mornings. The Americans have their Eggs Benedict, the Parisians their baguette; we Asians have our own signature morning meals, too. From Nasi Lemak, to Roti Prata and Kaya Toast, here’s a list of our favourite spots for some good ol’ breakfast fit for champions, served up local style. These delish treats are bound to start any day on the right foot. Dig in!

Chin Mee Chin Confectionery for Kaya Toast
To any old passerby, the powder blue exterior, tiled walls and rickety wooden chairs are just regular parts and furnishings of an old bakery. But to those in the know, this nostalgic East Coast bakery has been an institution for generations of families to get their dose of coffee and fluffy kaya buns. All the bakes, pastries and kaya at Chin Mee Chin are made in-house; as soon as you get within five metres of CMC, the waft of delicious kaya greets you. Order their signature buns, slightly toasted with a nice dollop of butter with black coffee, and find a cosy spot to relish your simple, quintessentially Singaporean breakfast.
 Chin Mee Chin Confectionery, 204 East Coast Road, Singapore 428903, (+65) 6354 0419

Selera Rasa for Nasi Lemak
Nasi Lemak is like the Asian version of Bacon and Eggs. There are carbohydrates, protein and the works all loaded onto a plate to give you that morning boost to get through the first part of your day. A set comes served with fragrant coconut rice, a crispy chicken wing or fish, an egg, some cucumber and peanuts with a dollop of sambal; there are many strong contenders for cooking up a mean Nasi Lemak but our money is on Selera Rasa’s iteration at Adam Road. Using Basmati Rice (not many places use Basmati Rice for Nasi Lemak), the light texture and flavour of coconut is enhanced, and when paired with their homemade sambal and sambal cuttlefish (optional) – it’s super shiok! We even heard from a little bird that the Sultan of Brunei loves the Nasi Lemak here. Well, if Selera Rasa’s Nasi Lemak is good enough for royalty, it sure is good enough for us, too!
Selera Rasa, 2 Adam Road, Singapore 289876, (+65) 9843 4509, www.selerarasa.com

Sin Ming Roti Prata for Roti Prata
Perhaps one of the most versatile recipes around, Roti Prata (Roti means bread and prata means flat) is an Indian bread that’s tossed around (no kidding!) and cooked over a flat grill. Inexpensive, fuss-free and delicious, Roti Prata is best served with a side of fish curry but also works well with other dips such as chicken curry or sugar, and even tastes amazing on its own. Because the dough of the Roti Prata at Sin Ming is made in-house, the texture of the bread is soft on the inside and crispy on the outside and is not overly oily. Order a glass of teh tarik (pulled tea) to complete your meal!
Sin Ming Roti Prata, Blk 24, #01-51 Sin Ming Road, Singapore 570024, (+65) 6453 3893

Rochor Original Beancurd for Youtiao and Soya Bean
Warm your tummies with some hot soya bean milk and dunk that crispy youtiao into your soy pudding while you’re at it! That’s how we like our youtiao and soy bean drink and pudding! The beancurd is fresh and its texture is very creamy and smooth, and you can choose to have it warm or cold with your preferred dose of sugar syrup. The youtiao (flour frittter), on the other hand, is a tasty treat on its own. While it seems like the perfect accompaniment to your drink, do give the other fried dough-y items a try, like butterfly buns or egg tarts.
Rochor Original Beancurd, 2 Short Street, Singapore 188211, (+65) 6741 7358, www.facebook.com/pages/Rochor-Original-Beancurd

Bedok Shui Guo for Chwee Kwai
Another popular staple among Singaporeans is chwee kwai; rice cakes topped off with fried radish. A must-eat for people who dine at Bedok Interchange’s hawker centre, Bedok Shui Guo is known to serve one of the cheapest-priced chwee kwai‘s in Singers and is dubbed to be the best in the east with its uber soft rice cakes. The friendly store owners cook up a mean fried radish and are happy to oblige your request for more chye poh, despite its low price.
Bedok Shui Guo, Blk 207, New Upper Changi Road, #01-53, Singapore 460207

Fhoul Madinah Istimewa for Kacang Pool
A simple Mediterranean stew, kacang pool is made from boiled broad beans — and that’s it! Topped off with a runny egg sunny side up, green chillies and diced onions, the homemade recipe hailing from Hadramaut is Fhoul Madinah Istimewa’s specialty as they literally only serve fhoul, fhoul and more fhoul. Tuck into your warm plate of kacang pool with a slice of baguette and smear your bread with the beans. The hint of green chillies and onions will remind you of tangy mexican salsa.
Fhoul Madinah Istimewa, 1 Geylang Serai, #02-114, Singapore 402001

Chey Sua Carrot Cake for Fried Carrot Cake
Famously known as one of the best carrot cake stalls in Singapore, Chey Sua Carrot Cake has even been invited to Sydney for Singapore Day! The humble carrot cake dish is essentially fried rice cake with black sauce (optional), plus radishes and egg. The version at Chey Sua is made up of tiny pieces of rice cakes in small aluminium bowls, fried to perfection with dried turnips on the side.
Chey Sua Carrot Cake, Blk 127, Toa Payoh Food Centre, #02-30, Singapore 311125, (+65) 9816 9412

Anandha Bhavan for Thosai
Thosai is the pretty sister of roti prata. Beneath her thin veneer of tanned crispy skin lies a generous mixture of ground lentils and rice flour. As the oldest Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore, Anandha Bhavan is the spot to hit for this South Indian and Sri Lankan dish. The pastry is crispy and soft at the same time, and rolled into a delicate and delicious map. Served with three dipping sauces: chilli, coconut chutney and sambar, the thosai is an understated beauty that delights many.

Home-Make Pau Specialist makes adorable and tasty bite-sized buns that are great if you’re in a hurry and need to just grab a little something on the go. Classic favourites are the barbecued pork, lotus paste and red bean paste. There are also mini coffee buns for those who can’t live without their coffee! Other dishes that get the love here are the siew mai, lor mai kai (glutinous rice with chicken) and fan choy (rice with meat and vegetables).

Your mama was right: breakfast IS the most important meal of the day. Not only does it get your metabolism going, but it can also give you a serious boost to carry you right through your crazy mornings. The Americans have their Eggs Benedict, the Parisians their baguette; we Asians have our own signature morning meals, too. From Nasi Lemak, to Roti Prata and Kaya Toast, here’s a list of our favourite spots for some good ol’ breakfast fit for champions, served up local style. These delish treats are bound to start any day on the right foot. Dig in!

Chin Mee Chin Confectionery for Kaya Toast
To any old passerby, the powder blue exterior, tiled walls and rickety wooden chairs are just regular parts and furnishings of an old bakery. But to those in the know, this nostalgic East Coast bakery has been an institution for generations of families to get their dose of coffee and fluffy kaya buns. All the bakes, pastries and kaya at Chin Mee Chin are made in-house; as soon as you get within five metres of CMC, the waft of delicious kaya greets you. Order their signature buns, slightly toasted with a nice dollop of butter with black coffee, and find a cosy spot to relish your simple, quintessentially Singaporean breakfast.
 Chin Mee Chin Confectionery, 204 East Coast Road, Singapore 428903, (+65) 6354 0419

Selera Rasa for Nasi Lemak
Nasi Lemak is like the Asian version of Bacon and Eggs. There are carbohydrates, protein and the works all loaded onto a plate to give you that morning boost to get through the first part of your day. A set comes served with fragrant coconut rice, a crispy chicken wing or fish, an egg, some cucumber and peanuts with a dollop of sambal; there are many strong contenders for cooking up a mean Nasi Lemak but our money is on Selera Rasa’s iteration at Adam Road. Using Basmati Rice (not many places use Basmati Rice for Nasi Lemak), the light texture and flavour of coconut is enhanced, and when paired with their homemade sambal and sambal cuttlefish (optional) – it’s super shiok! We even heard from a little bird that the Sultan of Brunei loves the Nasi Lemak here. Well, if Selera Rasa’s Nasi Lemak is good enough for royalty, it sure is good enough for us, too!
Selera Rasa, 2 Adam Road, Singapore 289876, (+65) 9843 4509, www.selerarasa.com

Sin Ming Roti Prata for Roti Prata
Perhaps one of the most versatile recipes around, Roti Prata (Roti means bread and prata means flat) is an Indian bread that’s tossed around (no kidding!) and cooked over a flat grill. Inexpensive, fuss-free and delicious, Roti Prata is best served with a side of fish curry but also works well with other dips such as chicken curry or sugar, and even tastes amazing on its own. Because the dough of the Roti Prata at Sin Ming is made in-house, the texture of the bread is soft on the inside and crispy on the outside and is not overly oily. Order a glass of teh tarik (pulled tea) to complete your meal!
Sin Ming Roti Prata, Blk 24, #01-51 Sin Ming Road, Singapore 570024, (+65) 6453 3893

Rochor Original Beancurd for Youtiao and Soya Bean
Warm your tummies with some hot soya bean milk and dunk that crispy youtiao into your soy pudding while you’re at it! That’s how we like our youtiao and soy bean drink and pudding! The beancurd is fresh and its texture is very creamy and smooth, and you can choose to have it warm or cold with your preferred dose of sugar syrup. The youtiao (flour frittter), on the other hand, is a tasty treat on its own. While it seems like the perfect accompaniment to your drink, do give the other fried dough-y items a try, like butterfly buns or egg tarts.
Rochor Original Beancurd, 2 Short Street, Singapore 188211, (+65) 6741 7358, www.facebook.com/pages/Rochor-Original-Beancurd

Bedok Shui Guo for Chwee Kwai
Another popular staple among Singaporeans is chwee kwai; rice cakes topped off with fried radish. A must-eat for people who dine at Bedok Interchange’s hawker centre, Bedok Shui Guo is known to serve one of the cheapest-priced chwee kwai‘s in Singers and is dubbed to be the best in the east with its uber soft rice cakes. The friendly store owners cook up a mean fried radish and are happy to oblige your request for more chye poh, despite its low price.
Bedok Shui Guo, Blk 207, New Upper Changi Road, #01-53, Singapore 460207

Fhoul Madinah Istimewa for Kacang Pool
A simple Mediterranean stew, kacang pool is made from boiled broad beans — and that’s it! Topped off with a runny egg sunny side up, green chillies and diced onions, the homemade recipe hailing from Hadramaut is Fhoul Madinah Istimewa’s specialty as they literally only serve fhoul, fhoul and more fhoul. Tuck into your warm plate of kacang pool with a slice of baguette and smear your bread with the beans. The hint of green chillies and onions will remind you of tangy mexican salsa.
Fhoul Madinah Istimewa, 1 Geylang Serai, #02-114, Singapore 402001

Chey Sua Carrot Cake for Fried Carrot Cake
Famously known as one of the best carrot cake stalls in Singapore, Chey Sua Carrot Cake has even been invited to Sydney for Singapore Day! The humble carrot cake dish is essentially fried rice cake with black sauce (optional), plus radishes and egg. The version at Chey Sua is made up of tiny pieces of rice cakes in small aluminium bowls, fried to perfection with dried turnips on the side.
Chey Sua Carrot Cake, Blk 127, Toa Payoh Food Centre, #02-30, Singapore 311125, (+65) 9816 9412

Anandha Bhavan for Thosai
Thosai is the pretty sister of roti prata. Beneath her thin veneer of tanned crispy skin lies a generous mixture of ground lentils and rice flour. As the oldest Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore, Anandha Bhavan is the spot to hit for this South Indian and Sri Lankan dish. The pastry is crispy and soft at the same time, and rolled into a delicate and delicious map. Served with three dipping sauces: chilli, coconut chutney and sambar, the thosai is an understated beauty that delights many.
Anandha Bhavan, 95 Syed Alwi Road, Singapore 207671, www.anandabhavan.com

No Name Teh Sarabat Stall for Teh Tarik & Roti Kahwin
Yes, this stall literally has no name but it’s a favourite spot of many who love teh tarik (pulled tea with milk) and roti kahwin. The hole-in-the-wall stall is hard to miss in the busy area of Kampung Glam with its blue exterior, not to mention its iconic elderly owner with his long white beard. Roti Kahwin is literally translated to ‘Marriage Bread’, which is essentially a combination of two slices of bread that sandwiches kaya and butter. A taste of the hot piping tea and bread for breakfast is all that one needs in the morning. Comfort food at its best!
No Name Teh Sarabat Stall, 21 Baghdad Street, Singapore 199660

		30 Best Dim Sum Restaurants In Singapore To Have Your Weekly Yum Cha

				

				May 15, 2018  by  Editorial

Whether it is a mid-afternoon high tea or weekend brunch ritual, dim sum is a Chinese staple we cannot get enough of. Essentially comprising a variety of both steamed and deep-fried snacks, these morsels are commonly paired with freshly brewed Chinese tea.
In Singapore, many Chinese families hold this age-old tradition in high esteem and even those of other races have learnt to appreciate dim sum, creating varieties to suit their own preferences and taste buds.
From the timeless favourites that still pull off dumplings the old fashioned way since our parent’s time—food carts and screaming old ladies included—to the modern restaurants that experiment with new flavours, here are 30 dim sum restaurants in Singapore for your weekly yum cha.

 


126 WEN DAO SHI

Nestled in supper haven, Geylang, 126 Wen Dao Shi is a hot spot for those in search of cheap and good dim sum. They may not be the most polished of eateries around, but make no mistake that for what they lack in outer appearance, they compensate greatly in food.
Some of our all-time favourite items to get are their Soft-Shell Crab, Liu Sha Bao and their Man Tou with Chilli Crab Sauce.

ASIA GRAND

Asia Grand is one Chinese restaurant that has stood the test of time. Situated on the ground floor of Odeon Towers, this long-standing restaurant is famous not just for their stellar dim sum but also the Peking Duck and Suckling Pig.
Start your day with some delectable dim sum such as Steamed Shrimp Dumplings and Steamed Cheong-Fun with Dough Fritter.

BAN HENG

At Ban Heng, you will never run out of options when it comes to their dim sum. Boasting over 30 dim sum items to choose from—which includes 15 deep-fried morsels of sheer goodness—deciding what to fill our bellies with is always a tough call.
If you need recommendations, their egg tarts and Barbecued Char Siew Pastry with Sesame are stellar dishes.

CRYSTAL JADE PALACE RESTAURANT

Crystal Jade Palace Restaurant serves up contemporary Cantonese cuisine and is a hot favourite among dim sum lovers. On their menu, there are over 30 dim sum items to try so visiting in a big group is recommended.

RED STAR RESTAURANT

Perhaps one of the few remaining authentic, old-school dim sum restaurants in Singapore—with middle-aged ladies pushing dim sum carts around—is Red Star Restaurant.
Red Star is nowhere near any of the finer dining dim sum concepts around, in fact, the restaurant is far from it. But what you can expect is a decent variety that encompasses the usual suspects such as chee cheong fun, har gau and more.

The Mini Egg Tarts (S$4.20++ for 3 pieces) are far better than your traditional flaky egg tarts. Buttery, crumbly and filled with a luscious egg filling, this is undeniably one of the best renditions in Singapore. Otherwise, their Deep-Fried Charcoal Chili Crab Meat Ball and Lobster with Pumpkin Congee are showstoppers in their own rights too.

VICTOR’S KITCHEN

Presumably having one of the best custard buns around, Victor’s Kitchen is a name that needs no introduction. Tucked away inside Sunshine Plaza, this dim sum eatery is a popular haunt among students and office workers.
Despite being a fairly affordable option in town, we must admit that their dim sum is good but not exactly our idea of mind-blowing. Still, if you happen to find yourself in the area, then Victor’s Kitchen is no doubt a good spot for you to get your hunger sorted.

		30 Best Dim Sum Restaurants In Singapore To Have Your Weekly Yum Cha

Whether it is a mid-afternoon high tea or weekend brunch ritual, dim sum is a Chinese staple we cannot get enough of. Essentially comprising a variety of both steamed and deep-fried snacks, these morsels are commonly paired with freshly brewed Chinese tea.
In Singapore, many Chinese families hold this age-old tradition in high esteem and even those of other races have learnt to appreciate dim sum, creating varieties to suit their own preferences and taste buds.
From the timeless favourites that still pull off dumplings the old fashioned way since our parent’s time—food carts and screaming old ladies included—to the modern restaurants that experiment with new flavours, here are 30 dim sum restaurants in Singapore for your weekly yum cha.

 


126 WEN DAO SHI

Nestled in supper haven, Geylang, 126 Wen Dao Shi is a hot spot for those in search of cheap and good dim sum. They may not be the most polished of eateries around, but make no mistake that for what they lack in outer appearance, they compensate greatly in food.
Some of our all-time favourite items to get are their Soft-Shell Crab, Liu Sha Bao and their Man Tou with Chilli Crab Sauce.

Perhaps one of the few remaining authentic, old-school dim sum restaurants in Singapore—with middle-aged ladies pushing dim sum carts around—is Red Star Restaurant.
Red Star is nowhere near any of the finer dining dim sum concepts around, in fact, the restaurant is far from it. But what you can expect is a decent variety that encompasses the usual suspects such as chee cheong fun, har gau and more.

Buttery, crumbly and filled with a luscious egg filling, this is undeniably one of the best renditions in Singapore.

		30 Best Dim Sum Restaurants In Singapore To Have Your Weekly Yum Cha

Whether it is a mid-afternoon high tea or weekend brunch ritual, dim sum is a Chinese staple we cannot get enough of. Essentially comprising a variety of both steamed and deep-fried snacks, these morsels are commonly paired with freshly brewed Chinese tea.
In Singapore, many Chinese families hold this age-old tradition in high esteem and even those of other races have learnt to appreciate dim sum, creating varieties to suit their own preferences and taste buds.
From the timeless favourites that still pull off dumplings the old fashioned way since our parent’s time—food carts and screaming old ladies included—to the modern restaurants that experiment with new flavours, here are 30 dim sum restaurants in Singapore for your weekly yum cha.

 


126 WEN DAO SHI

Nestled in supper haven, Geylang, 126 Wen Dao Shi is a hot spot for those in search of cheap and good dim sum. They may not be the most polished of eateries around, but make no mistake that for what they lack in outer appearance, they compensate greatly in food.
Some of our all-time favourite items to get are their Soft-Shell Crab, Liu Sha Bao and their Man Tou with Chilli Crab Sauce.

Whether it is a mid-afternoon high tea or weekend brunch ritual, dim sum is a Chinese staple we cannot get enough of. Essentially comprising a variety of both steamed and deep-fried snacks, these morsels are commonly paired with freshly brewed Chinese tea.
In Singapore, many Chinese families hold this age-old tradition in high esteem and even those of other races have learnt to appreciate dim sum, creating varieties to suit their own preferences and taste buds.
From the timeless favourites that still pull off dumplings the old fashioned way since our parent’s time—food carts and screaming old ladies included—to the modern restaurants that experiment with new flavours, here are 30 dim sum restaurants in Singapore for your weekly yum cha.

 


126 WEN DAO SHI

Nestled in supper haven, Geylang, 126 Wen Dao Shi is a hot spot for those in search of cheap and good dim sum. They may not be the most polished of eateries around, but make no mistake that for what they lack in outer appearance, they compensate greatly in food.
Some of our all-time favourite items to get are their Soft-Shell Crab, Liu Sha Bao and their Man Tou with Chilli Crab Sauce.

Whether it is a mid-afternoon high tea or weekend brunch ritual, dim sum is a Chinese staple we cannot get enough of. Essentially comprising a variety of both steamed and deep-fried snacks, these morsels are commonly paired with freshly brewed Chinese tea.
In Singapore, many Chinese families hold this age-old tradition in high esteem and even those of other races have learnt to appreciate dim sum, creating varieties to suit their own preferences and taste buds.
From the timeless favourites that still pull off dumplings the old fashioned way since our parent’s time—food carts and screaming old ladies included—to the modern restaurants that experiment with new flavours, here are 30 dim sum restaurants in Singapore for your weekly yum cha.

 


126 WEN DAO SHI

Nestled in supper haven, Geylang, 126 Wen Dao Shi is a hot spot for those in search of cheap and good dim sum. They may not be the most polished of eateries around, but make no mistake that for what they lack in outer appearance, they compensate greatly in food.
Some of our all-time favourite items to get are their Soft-Shell Crab, Liu Sha Bao and their Man Tou with Chilli Crab Sauce.

Whether it is a mid-afternoon high tea or weekend brunch ritual, dim sum is a Chinese staple we cannot get enough of. Essentially comprising a variety of both steamed and deep-fried snacks, these morsels are commonly paired with freshly brewed Chinese tea.
In Singapore, many Chinese families hold this age-old tradition in high esteem and even those of other races have learnt to appreciate dim sum, creating varieties to suit their own preferences and taste buds.
From the timeless favourites that still pull off dumplings the old fashioned way since our parent’s time—food carts and screaming old ladies included—to the modern restaurants that experiment with new flavours, here are 30 dim sum restaurants in Singapore for your weekly yum cha.

 


126 WEN DAO SHI

Nestled in supper haven, Geylang, 126 Wen Dao Shi is a hot spot for those in search of cheap and good dim sum. They may not be the most polished of eateries around, but make no mistake that for what they lack in outer appearance, they compensate greatly in food.

Perhaps one of the few remaining authentic, old-school dim sum restaurants in Singapore—with middle-aged ladies pushing dim sum carts around—is Red Star Restaurant.
Red Star is nowhere near any of the finer dining dim sum concepts around, in fact, the restaurant is far from it. But what you can expect is a decent variety that encompasses the usual suspects such as chee cheong fun, har gau and more.

Buttery, crumbly and filled with a luscious egg filling, this is undeniably one of the best renditions in Singapore. Otherwise, their Deep-Fried Charcoal Chili Crab Meat Ball and Lobster with Pumpkin Congee are showstoppers in their own rights too.

Presumably having one of the best custard buns around, Victor’s Kitchen is a name that needs no introduction. Tucked away inside Sunshine Plaza, this dim sum eatery is a popular haunt among students and office workers.
Despite being a fairly affordable option in town, we must admit that their dim sum is good but not exactly our idea of mind-blowing. Still, if you happen to find yourself in the area, then Victor’s Kitchen is no doubt a good spot for you to get your hunger sorted.

RED STAR RESTAURANT

Perhaps one of the few remaining authentic, old-school dim sum restaurants in Singapore—with middle-aged ladies pushing dim sum carts around—is Red Star Restaurant.
Red Star is nowhere near any of the finer dining dim sum concepts around, in fact, the restaurant is far from it. But what you can expect is a decent variety that encompasses the usual suspects such as chee cheong fun, har gau and more.

The Mini Egg Tarts (S$4.20++ for 3 pieces) are far better than your traditional flaky egg tarts. Buttery, crumbly and filled with a luscious egg filling, this is undeniably one of the best renditions in Singapore. Otherwise, their Deep-Fried Charcoal Chili Crab Meat Ball and Lobster with Pumpkin Congee are showstoppers in their own rights too.

Presumably having one of the best custard buns around, Victor’s Kitchen is a name that needs no introduction. Tucked away inside Sunshine Plaza, this dim sum eatery is a popular haunt among students and office workers.
Despite being a fairly affordable option in town, we must admit that their dim sum is good but not exactly our idea of mind-blowing. Still, if you happen to find yourself in the area, then Victor’s Kitchen is no doubt a good spot for you to get your hunger sorted.

Cheap seafood buffets in Singapore below $50
 

Image adapted from: Eatbook
Buffets aren’t just about eating our favourite food, it’s also about getting our money’s worth - and so many of us swarm to the seafood section the moment we grab our plates.
Given how pricey fresh seafood can be, expansive seafood spreads are more frequently found in atas hotels. But we’ve sussed out a list of affordable, non-hotel seafood buffets for you seafood lovers. Free-flow crabs, lobsters, prawns, and oysters, all under $50? Count me in.
 
1. Tunglok seafood - from $26.80
 

Image credit: @pei_ching
No doubt that Tunglok Seafood is well-established, but their ala carte buffets come at a surprisingly non-exorbitant price tag. 

Image credit: @lovemhaylee
From just $26.80, you can order as many seafood delights off their ala carte buffet menu, such as black pepper crab, chilli crab, and deep-fried sugarcane prawns. 
You’ll also need at least 4 people for a table, so do call along your fellow seafood-lovers. After all, sharing your dishes gives you more stomach space to enjoy a wider variety! 
Orchard outlet:Address: 181 Orchard Road, #11-05, Orchard Central, Singapore 238896Telephone: 6834 4888Opening hours: Mon-Sat: Lunch: 1130AM-3PM | Dinner: 6PM-1030PMSun & PH: Lunch: 10AM - 3PM | Dinner: 6PM-1030PMPrice: Ala carte Lunch Buffet:Mon-Fri: Adult: $26.80 | Child: $16.70Sat, Sun and PH: Adult: $28.80 | Child: $18.80Ala Carte Dinner BuffetDaily: Adult: $38.80 | Child: $28.80

2. Aroy Jing Jing - from $29.90
 

Image credit: @felpalz
You’ll be leaving Aroy Jing Jing smelling like BBQ, but also with a satisfied belly full from all sorts of fresh seafood - including slipper lobsters, half-shell scallops, flower crabs and bamboo clams. I’ve got no complaints about that. 

Image credit: @jothemojo
Their “all-you-can-eat” seafood buffet is largely in DIY-style - you’ll be BBQ-ing your favourite seafood over charcoal flames. And it’s not just seafood here -  Aroy Jing Jing also has yakitori wings, bacon strips and cheese tofu, along with free-flow ice cream and drinks to complete the experience.
Note: The seafood BBQ has a time limit of 90 minutes.
Address: 81 Lorong Chencharu, #01-05, ORTO, Singapore 769198 Telephone: 6257 2328Opening hours: Mon - Fri & PH Eve: 5PM-12AMSat, Sun, & PH: 3PM-1AMPrice: Mon-Thurs:  $29.90 | Fri, Sat, Sun, PH & PH Eve: $32.90Website
 
3. Orchid Roast Fish - from $18.80
 

Image credit: @liptakang
Scrumptious food can be found all around Chinatown, and here’s one restaurant there to pamper yourself with some mouthwatering seafood. 
For those who love all things fishy, check out the Grilled Fish Buffet (from $18.80) at Orchard Roast Fish, where you can enjoy unlimited servings of freshly grilled seabass in 9 different flavours. 

Image credit: @yuanyuanlollipop 
The 9 different flavours are: 

fragrant spices
special recipe sauce
fermented soya bean sauce
pickled chilli
original spicy
signature extra spicy
chicken broth with mushroom
Sichuan style sauerkraut
black pepper sauce. 

Besides unlimited seabass, the buffet also comes with a free-flow of over 40 different sides - including lobster ball, baby cuttlefish, pork belly and homemade dumplings.
Note: Buffet dining is limited to 2 hours. 
Address: 68 Pagoda Street, Singapore 059221Telephone: 6221 6369Opening hours: 1130AM-11PM, Daily Price:Mon-Thurs & PH Eve: $18.80Fri-Sun & PH: $22.80Website
 
4. Vienna International Seafood and Teppanyaki Restaurant - from $39.90
 

Image credit: Vienna International Seafood and Teppanyaki Buffet Restaurant  
Vienna International Seafood and Teppanyaki Restaurant is a bit of a mouthful, but it sure lives up to its name with its wide variety of cuisines, from Chinese spicy crabs and oat prawns, to Western-style oysters, and Japanese sashimi. 

Image credit: @thirdy_galore 
On top of their already affordable buffet prices (from $39.80), they’ve also got regular discounts for you to enjoy. Check out their lobangs on their facebook page here!

5. Buffet Town - from $26.80
 

Image credit: @kaiei79 
Buffet Town is situated right in the CBD area, so you can stuff your face with fresh marine fare right after a stressful day at work.

Cheap seafood buffets in Singapore below $50
 

Image adapted from: Eatbook
Buffets aren’t just about eating our favourite food, it’s also about getting our money’s worth - and so many of us swarm to the seafood section the moment we grab our plates.
Given how pricey fresh seafood can be, expansive seafood spreads are more frequently found in atas hotels. But we’ve sussed out a list of affordable, non-hotel seafood buffets for you seafood lovers. Free-flow crabs, lobsters, prawns, and oysters, all under $50? Count me in.
 
1. Tunglok seafood - from $26.80
 

Image credit: @pei_ching
No doubt that Tunglok Seafood is well-established, but their ala carte buffets come at a surprisingly non-exorbitant price tag. 

Image credit: @lovemhaylee
From just $26.80, you can order as many seafood delights off their ala carte buffet menu, such as black pepper crab, chilli crab, and deep-fried sugarcane prawns. 
You’ll also need at least 4 people for a table, so do call along your fellow seafood-lovers. After all, sharing your dishes gives you more stomach space to enjoy a wider variety! 
Orchard outlet:Address: 181 Orchard Road, #11-05, Orchard Central, Singapore 238896Telephone: 6834 4888Opening hours: Mon-Sat: Lunch: 1130AM-3PM | Dinner: 6PM-1030PMSun & PH: Lunch: 10AM - 3PM | Dinner: 6PM-1030PMPrice: Ala carte Lunch Buffet:Mon-Fri: Adult: $26.80 | Child: $16.70Sat, Sun and PH: Adult: $28.80 | Child: $18.80Ala Carte Dinner BuffetDaily: Adult: $38.80 | Child: $28.80

2. Aroy Jing Jing - from $29.90
 

Image credit: @felpalz
You’ll be leaving Aroy Jing Jing smelling like BBQ, but also with a satisfied belly full from all sorts of fresh seafood - including slipper lobsters, half-shell scallops, flower crabs and bamboo clams. I’ve got no complaints about that. 

Image credit: @jothemojo
Their “all-you-can-eat” seafood buffet is largely in DIY-style - you’ll be BBQ-ing your favourite seafood over charcoal flames. And it’s not just seafood here -  Aroy Jing Jing also has yakitori wings, bacon strips and cheese tofu, along with free-flow ice cream and drinks to complete the experience.
Note: The seafood BBQ has a time limit of 90 minutes.
Address: 81 Lorong Chencharu, #01-05, ORTO, Singapore 769198 Telephone: 6257 2328Opening hours: Mon - Fri & PH Eve: 5PM-12AMSat, Sun, & PH: 3PM-1AMPrice: Mon-Thurs:  $29.90 | Fri, Sat, Sun, PH & PH Eve: $32.90Website
 
3. Orchid Roast Fish - from $18.80
 

Image credit: @liptakang
Scrumptious food can be found all around Chinatown, and here’s one restaurant there to pamper yourself with some mouthwatering seafood. 
For those who love all things fishy, check out the Grilled Fish Buffet (from $18.80) at Orchard Roast Fish, where you can enjoy unlimited servings of freshly grilled seabass in 9 different flavours. 

Image credit: @yuanyuanlollipop 
The 9 different flavours are: 

fragrant spices
special recipe sauce
fermented soya bean sauce
pickled chilli
original spicy
signature extra spicy
chicken broth with mushroom
Sichuan style sauerkraut
black pepper sauce. 

Besides unlimited seabass, the buffet also comes with a free-flow of over 40 different sides - including lobster ball, baby cuttlefish, pork belly and homemade dumplings.
Note: Buffet dining is limited to 2 hours. 
Address: 68 Pagoda Street, Singapore 059221Telephone: 6221 6369Opening hours: 1130AM-11PM, Daily Price:Mon-Thurs & PH Eve: $18.80Fri-Sun & PH: $22.80Website
 
4. Vienna International Seafood and Teppanyaki Restaurant - from $39.90
 

Image credit: Vienna International Seafood and Teppanyaki Buffet Restaurant  
Vienna International Seafood and Teppanyaki Restaurant is a bit of a mouthful, but it sure lives up to its name with its wide variety of cuisines, from Chinese spicy crabs and oat prawns, to Western-style oysters, and Japanese sashimi. 

Image credit: @thirdy_galore 
On top of their already affordable buffet prices (from $39.80), they’ve also got regular discounts for you to enjoy. Check out their lobangs on their facebook page here!

5. Buffet Town - from $26.80
 

Image credit: @kaiei79 
Buffet Town is situated right in the CBD area, so you can stuff your face with fresh marine fare right after a stressful day at work. 

Image credit: @idlelline 
At reasonable prices from just $26.80, the spread at Buffet Town is extensive - apart from fresh seafood like shucked oysters and thick sashimi slices, they’ve also got sushi, local delights like rojak, and Western dishes like Aglio Olio.
With a seating capacity of 500, Buffet Town also makes a good place for large group gatherings. It still gets pretty crowded though, so do make a reservation to secure your seats!

Cheap seafood buffets in Singapore below $50
 

Image adapted from: Eatbook
Buffets aren’t just about eating our favourite food, it’s also about getting our money’s worth - and so many of us swarm to the seafood section the moment we grab our plates.
Given how pricey fresh seafood can be, expansive seafood spreads are more frequently found in atas hotels. But we’ve sussed out a list of affordable, non-hotel seafood buffets for you seafood lovers. Free-flow crabs, lobsters, prawns, and oysters, all under $50? Count me in.
 
1. Tunglok seafood - from $26.80
 

Image credit: @pei_ching
No doubt that Tunglok Seafood is well-established, but their ala carte buffets come at a surprisingly non-exorbitant price tag. 

Image credit: @lovemhaylee
From just $26.80, you can order as many seafood delights off their ala carte buffet menu, such as black pepper crab, chilli crab, and deep-fried sugarcane prawns. 
You’ll also need at least 4 people for a table, so do call along your fellow seafood-lovers. After all, sharing your dishes gives you more stomach space to enjoy a wider variety!

Image credit: @jothemojo
Their “all-you-can-eat” seafood buffet is largely in DIY-style - you’ll be BBQ-ing your favourite seafood over charcoal flames.

Cheap seafood buffets in Singapore below $50
 

Image adapted from: Eatbook
Buffets aren’t just about eating our favourite food, it’s also about getting our money’s worth - and so many of us swarm to the seafood section the moment we grab our plates.
Given how pricey fresh seafood can be, expansive seafood spreads are more frequently found in atas hotels. But we’ve sussed out a list of affordable, non-hotel seafood buffets for you seafood lovers. Free-flow crabs, lobsters, prawns, and oysters, all under $50? Count me in.
 
1. Tunglok seafood - from $26.80

No doubt that Tunglok Seafood is well-established, but their ala carte buffets come at a surprisingly non-exorbitant price tag.

From just $26.80, you can order as many seafood delights off their ala carte buffet menu, such as black pepper crab, chilli crab, and deep-fried sugarcane prawns. 
You’ll also need at least 4 people for a table, so do call along your fellow seafood-lovers. After all, sharing your dishes gives you more stomach space to enjoy a wider variety!

Cheap seafood buffets in Singapore below $50
 

Image adapted from: Eatbook
Buffets aren’t just about eating our favourite food, it’s also about getting our money’s worth - and so many of us swarm to the seafood section the moment we grab our plates.
Given how pricey fresh seafood can be, expansive seafood spreads are more frequently found in atas hotels. But we’ve sussed out a list of affordable, non-hotel seafood buffets for you seafood lovers. Free-flow crabs, lobsters, prawns, and oysters, all under $50? Count me in.
 
1. Tunglok seafood - from $26.80
 

Image credit: @pei_ching
No doubt that Tunglok Seafood is well-established, but their ala carte buffets come at a surprisingly non-exorbitant price tag. 

Image credit: @lovemhaylee
From just $26.80, you can order as many seafood delights off their ala carte buffet menu, such as black pepper crab, chilli crab, and deep-fried sugarcane prawns. 
You’ll also need at least 4 people for a table, so do call along your fellow seafood-lovers. After all, sharing your dishes gives you more stomach space to enjoy a wider variety!

You’ll be leaving Aroy Jing Jing smelling like BBQ, but also with a satisfied belly full from all sorts of fresh seafood - including slipper lobsters, half-shell scallops, flower crabs and bamboo clams. I’ve got no complaints about that.

Image adapted from: Eatbook
Buffets aren’t just about eating our favourite food, it’s also about getting our money’s worth - and so many of us swarm to the seafood section the moment we grab our plates.

Cheap seafood buffets in Singapore below $50
 

Image adapted from: Eatbook
Buffets aren’t just about eating our favourite food, it’s also about getting our money’s worth - and so many of us swarm to the seafood section the moment we grab our plates.
Given how pricey fresh seafood can be, expansive seafood spreads are more frequently found in atas hotels. But we’ve sussed out a list of affordable, non-hotel seafood buffets for you seafood lovers. Free-flow crabs, lobsters, prawns, and oysters, all under $50? Count me in.
 
1. Tunglok seafood - from $26.80

No doubt that Tunglok Seafood is well-established, but their ala carte buffets come at a surprisingly non-exorbitant price tag.

From just $26.80, you can order as many seafood delights off their ala carte buffet menu, such as black pepper crab, chilli crab, and deep-fried sugarcane prawns. 
You’ll also need at least 4 people for a table, so do call along your fellow seafood-lovers. After all, sharing your dishes gives you more stomach space to enjoy a wider variety!

Cheap seafood buffets in Singapore below $50
 

Image adapted from: Eatbook
Buffets aren’t just about eating our favourite food, it’s also about getting our money’s worth - and so many of us swarm to the seafood section the moment we grab our plates.
Given how pricey fresh seafood can be, expansive seafood spreads are more frequently found in atas hotels. But we’ve sussed out a list of affordable, non-hotel seafood buffets for you seafood lovers. Free-flow crabs, lobsters, prawns, and oysters, all under $50? Count me in.
 
1. Tunglok seafood - from $26.80

No doubt that Tunglok Seafood is well-established, but their ala carte buffets come at a surprisingly non-exorbitant price tag. 

Image credit: @lovemhaylee
From just $26.80, you can order as many seafood delights off their ala carte buffet menu, such as black pepper crab, chilli crab, and deep-fried sugarcane prawns. 
You’ll also need at least 4 people for a table, so do call along your fellow seafood-lovers. After all, sharing your dishes gives you more stomach space to enjoy a wider variety!

Image credit: @lovemhaylee
From just $26.80, you can order as many seafood delights off their ala carte buffet menu, such as black pepper crab, chilli crab, and deep-fried sugarcane prawns. 
You’ll also need at least 4 people for a table, so do call along your fellow seafood-lovers. After all, sharing your dishes gives you more stomach space to enjoy a wider variety!

The Best Burgers in Singapore under $15
 
Imagine sinking your mouth into a succulent burger, revelling in the delightful taste as its flavours burst open into your open hungry mouth. 
Many of us Singaporeans simply love burgers. We find ourselves patronising restaurants, cafes and bars, looking for the best burgers in the vicinity. Our love for them is further proven by the throngs of Western stalls opening up in our local hawker and food centres.
Burgers are the epitome of fast-food restaurants. They practically scream ""UNHEALTHY!"", but who cares, right? The real question is, where can we find the best value-for-money burgers?
Well, search no more. In this article, we have hand-picked a list of 15 of the most delicious burgers under $15. Warning - you're going to become very hungry.

The Best Burgers in Singapore under $15
 
Imagine sinking your mouth into a succulent burger, revelling in the delightful taste as its flavours burst open into your open hungry mouth. 
Many of us Singaporeans simply love burgers. We find ourselves patronising restaurants, cafes and bars, looking for the best burgers in the vicinity. Our love for them is further proven by the throngs of Western stalls opening up in our local hawker and food centres.
Burgers are the epitome of fast-food restaurants. They practically scream ""UNHEALTHY!"", but who cares, right? The real question is, where can we find the best value-for-money burgers?
Well, search no more. In this article, we have hand-picked a list of 15 of the most delicious burgers under $15. Warning - you're going to become very hungry.
 
1. The Brat

Cheap Food In Orchard Road 
 
Noble quests have always faced skepticism. 
Prior to my hunt for meals below $10 in Orchard Road, I surveyed my friends. Some looked at me as if I had just suggested we pool our savings to buy a unicorn. “Siao ah, this is Singapore babe”, they reminded me. One guy suggested McDonald’s. Oh, pure and utter audacity. 
Remember the days when Chicken Rice was $1? Me neither, but my parents would. Contrary to popular belief and common Singapore complaints, it’s possible to dine in Orchard Road without burning a hole in your pocket.
Here are 18 wallet-friendly meals you never knew about. 
 
1. Shi Li Fang Hotpot
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
At a price of $9.90++, choose from the Beef Tenderloin, Special Fish Head, Specialty Chicken/Pork Tenderloin, Pork Belly, Mushroom or Vegetables lunchtime (till 4pm) set meals. Each meal comes with a vegetables platter and a choice of handmade/egg noodles, rice or vermicelli. Also, every hotpot is personal so you reserve all rights to pick that soup base all your friends hate!
The total bill should come up to about $12 after tax, but what’s an extra few dollars when most hotpot restaurants in Orchard Road cost at least $30?
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #07-10/11, S(238896)
 
2. Tsuru-Koshi Udon
 

Damage: $10
From a selection of Udon and Donburi below $14, I ordered the Ebi Tempura Udon ($10). The soup was slightly salty without being overwhelming. The Udon was silky and smooth as promised when enjoyed with the Onsen Egg ($1). Though I would like my tempura to be crispier, this is the go-to place when you’re craving something hot and soupy. Many patrons are Japanese themselves!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B201-3, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
3. Hainanese Delicacy 
 

Damage: $4
I seriously suspect that I’m the only noob who has never tried this. I don’t care that it’s been reviewed to death! I need to gush about it once more to get it out of my system. 
Even though it was lunchtime, the line at Hainanese Delicacy moved quickly. I loved that the boneless meat of the Roasted Chicken Rice ($4) fully captured the sauce’s essence in its tender goodness, but it was the chilli that won me over. I don’t wanna jinx it, but this may be the best I’ve had.
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-116, S(228213)
 
4. Fisherios 
 

Damage: $7.90
Fisherios at Takashimaya Food Basement is hard to miss - with its inviting display of oysters and the smell of freshly fried fish. With a specialty in the Beer Battered Fish & Chips ($7.90), other house specials include Breaded fish ($8.90), Snapper ($9.90), Salmon ($9.90), and Shrimp ($8.90). This puts an end to paying $20 for a plate of fish & chips!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-4-2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
5. Dong Dae Mun
 

Damage: Sticks of meat from $1
Dong Dae Mun at Somerset 313 is the only outlet islandwide that serves meals like Kimchi Fried Rice and Korean Ramyun, within a dining space that fits about 12 people. 
The tantalising sight of sauce sizzling on the hot plate didn’t disappoint. Even though the chicken slices were thin, the portion was fairly large and well worth the money.
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-49, S(238895)
 
6. Kim Dae Mun
 
Source
Damage: Under $8
Further down the road is another Korean food spot to check out on the second floor of Concorde Hotel. There’s often a long queue in spite of its remote location, and it isn’t difficult to see why. Set meals and side dishes are priced below $8, and patrons have raved about the prices and authenticity.
Also, rumor has it that the hotplate items are cooked with water instead of oil!
Address: #02-17/18 Concorde Hotel Singapore, 100 Orchard Road, S(238840)
 
7. Ayam Penyet Ria
 

Damage: $7.90
The Ayam Penyet ($7.90) was a mouth-watering sight - crumbs everywhere! Throughout the whole meal, I was that ridiculous emoji with heart shapes for eyes.  
The chefs mastered the art of deep-frying chicken - the skin was crispy but the thigh meat was still moist. It’s sinful but worth every calorie. You must order a drink because the chili was so intense, my tongue burned all the way from Lucky Plaza to Far East Plaza. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #04-25, S(238863)
 
8. Pies & Coffee
 
Source
Damage: $6
If you love a pie but hate the mess of having it to-go, dine in at Pies & Coffee! With a menu that carries both sweet and savory pies priced between $6-12, it’s an ideal spot for a meal or snack. Savory pies are served with a side of mashed potatoes and salad greens. 
Address: The Centrepoint, 176 Orchard Road, #01-101-104, S(238843)  
 
9. Yonehachi 
 

Damage: $7.80
Meet Okowa rice, cousin of Lo Mai Kai,  only less greasy and of a Japanese descent. Each mouthful of the Salmon Okowa Rice Set ($7.80) was wholesome and tasty, best enjoyed with the side of pickles. This set comes in 4 other flavors and suit small to moderate eaters best. Go for the larger set meals with Unagi or Chicken Teriyaki if you’d like something more substantial. 
Tip: If you don’t have time to dine in, takeaway options are available too! 
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-1/2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
10. New Station Snack Bar
 

Damage: $6
This zi char shop is usually crowded and cramped, but discomfort is a small price to pay for my Salted Egg Pork Ribs Rice ($6). The pork ribs are soft and the salted egg sauce was easily the highlight of the dish. The curry leaves and chili padi gave it a tinge of spiciness, so it was creamy without being overly jelat. 
Tip: This dish is only on the Chinese menu so if you can’t read those characters to save your life, it’s No. 6. You’re welcome. 
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-95, S(228213)
 
11. Smoothie King 
 
Source
Damage: $6-7
On days when I’m feeling healthy, I try to avoid eye contact with the bubble tea shop and go to Smoothie King instead, where my first smoothie won half my heart just by being pastel-colored. 
A smoothie easily cost about $6-7, but the $9.90 set meal gets you an additional wrap or salad. It’s a triumph to score a meal in Orchard for $10, but to have it for under 500 calories is pure win! 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #01-14/15, S(238895)
 
12. Riverside Indonesian BBQ
 
Source
Damage: $6
Fans of the famous Indonesian BBQ Store in Plaza Singapura Kopitiam will be excited to know that 313 Somerset and Ion Orchard are homes to 2 other branches. With a specialty in the Ayam Panggang, the shop is known for using only fresh chicken.
After machine-dipping it into their signature black sauce, it’s served with steamed rice and topped with coconut curry. Most dishes, including squid and fish cooked with the same technique, cost around $6 on average. 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-44, S(238895)
 
13. Thai Tantric
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
Most people flock to Jane Thai at Orchard Towers, but its opening hours (evening only) are a real bummer. Thai Tantric’s opening hours (11am-3pm, 6pm-3am) are friendlier because no lust for Thai food should go unsatisfied. 
Popular dishes include Phad Thai ($6.50), Tom Yum Seafood Soup ($10) and Fried Glass Noodles with Seafood ($7), while most side dishes are priced below $10. Orchard Towers may not be the most pristine mall around, but great prices and authenticity rarely reside in upscale grounds and polished walls. 
Address: Orchard Towers, 400 Orchard Road, #03-23, S(238875)
 
14. Astons Specialities
 
Source
Damage: $6.90
Astons Specialties is a restaurant that requires no introduction, and one of the few I find worth queueing for. Apart from the steaks and chops, most pastas, burgers and fish dishes go for below $10. I love the flexibility in selecting sides, though I always find myself ending up with Mac & Cheese and Garden Vegetables. 
Address: #03-04 *SCAPE, 2 Orchard Link, S(237978)
 
15. Gyoza-Ya
 


Damage: $6.50
The Pan-fried Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had perfect skin - thin, crispy, and not too greasy. The chives and vegetable bits added texture to the sweet and soft pork filling. On the other hand, the Steamed Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had a soft and luscious exterior, served with their house special sauce. I personally preferred the former as I found the sauce to be a little too salty.  
This little-known place is ambient and surprisingly affordable. Sides are priced between $3.80-6.80, while mains cost $6.50-$6.80. It’s Robinsons’ well-kept secret!
Address: Robinsons Heeren, 260 Orchard Road, #B1-02A, S(238855)
 
16. River Valley Nasi Lemak 
 

Damage: $3.80
The cheapest of the lot is found at $3.80 at a remote corner of Lucky Plaza’s basement. I love the rice and chili best - foundation of any Nasi Lemak. The rice was some of the most fragrant I’ve tasted - each bite flavorful with coconut milk, perfect when paired with the sambal chili. The sides tasted average at best, but the variety is well worth the price. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #B1-99/101, S(238863)
 
17. Quiznos  
 

Damage: $6.90
As I unwrapped it my 6-inch Classic Italian Sub ($6.90), I judged it a little; it wasn’t the most good-looking sandwich. But the misunderstood sub soon redeemed itself.
The freshly toasted Rosemary Parmesan bread was so good it can be eaten on its own, appetizing with its aroma of herb and cheese combined. It would be perfect if the vegetables were fresher and crunchier, but the meats made up for it. Topped with mozzarella and red wine vinaigrette, the deli meats (pepperoni, salami, capicola and ham) were juicier and tastier than that of any other sub!
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #03-31, S(238896)
 
18. Jtown Cafe
 
SourceSource
Damage: Under $8
Jtown is an eatery located at the basement of Midpoint Orchard that serves Indonesian delicacies. Mains like the Bakmie Aya Bakso (pictured above) and the Black Pepper Bakso, which seems like the Indonesian version of Jajamen will cost you no more than $8, complete with a drink. There’s a variety of interesting Murtabak as well, with flavors like cheese, chocolate and even durian.
Address:#B1-04/05 Midpoint Orchard, 220 Orchard Road, S(238852)
 
19. Eighteen Chefs 
 
Source
Damage: $6.40
Back when I was in school, 18 Chefs was a regular hangout. Today, the menu has grown about 3 times more extensive, but the student meal still costs $6.40 - a price I remember to be constant throughout these years. Even if you’re not a student, the “Be Your Own Chef” option remains a highly popular and customizable classic for baked rice and pastas below $10.
Address: #04-02 Cineleisure Orchard, 8 Grange Road, S(239695)
 
20. Central Hong Kong Cafe
 
Source
Damage: Under $10.
Unlike most Hong Kong cafes, this shop makes you stop in your tracks to admire the furnishing. With patterned tiles and grilles, old school celebrity posters and a soundtrack made up of Cantonese oldies, it’s clear that a lot of thought went into the creating an ambience. As most of the popular street food such as egg noodles and specialty toasts are priced affordably, you can easily dine for less than $10.
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #02-30, S(238896)
 
21. Greenview Cafe
 

Damage: $4.50
In different shapes and sizes, the Mee Hoon Kueh Dry ($4.50) at Greenview Cafe is handmade, unlike the identical machine-cut squares sold at food courts. The thicker slices may not be for everyone, but I personally loved the Q-ness. The prawns (with an alternative of minced pork) were fresh and crisp while the sauce was the right amounts of sweet and salty, making this a favorite comfort food accessible in town. 
Address: Far East Plaza, 14 Scotts Road, #04-96, S(228213)
 
22. Gyoza no Ohsho
 
Source
Damage: $10
Ohsho is a Japanese casual dining joint located in Cuppage Plaza, within walking distance of Somerset MRT. In spite of its small size, the menu is quite extensive. Ramen here starts from $11, but for less than $10, you’d be able to get Yakiudon or Yakisoba, and a selection of rice dishes. For more value, look out for the set meals they offer!
Address: #01-10 Cuppage Plaza, 5 Koek Road, S(228796)
 
Bonus: Espuma Lab 
 
Source
Here’s something extra for those who’re willing to walk for cheap food. Which should mean everyone. 
Espuma Lab in PoMo features Michelin-style culinary methods like Espuma (foam) and Sous Vide (thermal circulator). Those are interesting techniques to pay attention to if you aren’t distracted by the prices yet.
Main courses are unbelievably priced at - get this - $6.80! Top-ups for a drink and a bowl of soup cost only $2. If you’re an all-day breakfast fanatic, this place also makes poached eggs with a side of Norwegian Salmon or Sauteed Mushrooms for less than $5!
Address: 1 Selegie Road, #01-20/21, PoMo,  S(188306)
 
Busting the Myth
 
There are many different ways people spend $10 in town these days. Some buy a Venti beverage because Starbucks’ Christmas Drinks can take all their money, while others join a froyo queue so long a security guard is stationed to manage it. 
If you can no longer enjoy the privilege of flashing your student card, it’s unlikely that $10 will get you much in today’s economy. We hope this article has helped you discover more choices in every nook and cranny of Orchard Road!
In fact, if you’re savvy enough, you may even have money left for dessert: Source

Cheap Food In Orchard Road 
 
Noble quests have always faced skepticism. 
Prior to my hunt for meals below $10 in Orchard Road, I surveyed my friends. Some looked at me as if I had just suggested we pool our savings to buy a unicorn. “Siao ah, this is Singapore babe”, they reminded me. One guy suggested McDonald’s. Oh, pure and utter audacity. 
Remember the days when Chicken Rice was $1? Me neither, but my parents would. Contrary to popular belief and common Singapore complaints, it’s possible to dine in Orchard Road without burning a hole in your pocket.
Here are 18 wallet-friendly meals you never knew about. 
 
1. Shi Li Fang Hotpot
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
At a price of $9.90++, choose from the Beef Tenderloin, Special Fish Head, Specialty Chicken/Pork Tenderloin, Pork Belly, Mushroom or Vegetables lunchtime (till 4pm) set meals. Each meal comes with a vegetables platter and a choice of handmade/egg noodles, rice or vermicelli. Also, every hotpot is personal so you reserve all rights to pick that soup base all your friends hate!
The total bill should come up to about $12 after tax, but what’s an extra few dollars when most hotpot restaurants in Orchard Road cost at least $30?
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #07-10/11, S(238896)
 
2. Tsuru-Koshi Udon
 

Damage: $10
From a selection of Udon and Donburi below $14, I ordered the Ebi Tempura Udon ($10). The soup was slightly salty without being overwhelming. The Udon was silky and smooth as promised when enjoyed with the Onsen Egg ($1). Though I would like my tempura to be crispier, this is the go-to place when you’re craving something hot and soupy. Many patrons are Japanese themselves!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B201-3, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
3. Hainanese Delicacy 
 

Damage: $4
I seriously suspect that I’m the only noob who has never tried this. I don’t care that it’s been reviewed to death! I need to gush about it once more to get it out of my system. 
Even though it was lunchtime, the line at Hainanese Delicacy moved quickly. I loved that the boneless meat of the Roasted Chicken Rice ($4) fully captured the sauce’s essence in its tender goodness, but it was the chilli that won me over. I don’t wanna jinx it, but this may be the best I’ve had.
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-116, S(228213)
 
4. Fisherios 
 

Damage: $7.90
Fisherios at Takashimaya Food Basement is hard to miss - with its inviting display of oysters and the smell of freshly fried fish. With a specialty in the Beer Battered Fish & Chips ($7.90), other house specials include Breaded fish ($8.90), Snapper ($9.90), Salmon ($9.90), and Shrimp ($8.90). This puts an end to paying $20 for a plate of fish & chips!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-4-2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
5. Dong Dae Mun
 

Damage: Sticks of meat from $1
Dong Dae Mun at Somerset 313 is the only outlet islandwide that serves meals like Kimchi Fried Rice and Korean Ramyun, within a dining space that fits about 12 people. 
The tantalising sight of sauce sizzling on the hot plate didn’t disappoint. Even though the chicken slices were thin, the portion was fairly large and well worth the money.
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-49, S(238895)
 
6. Kim Dae Mun
 
Source
Damage: Under $8
Further down the road is another Korean food spot to check out on the second floor of Concorde Hotel. There’s often a long queue in spite of its remote location, and it isn’t difficult to see why. Set meals and side dishes are priced below $8, and patrons have raved about the prices and authenticity.
Also, rumor has it that the hotplate items are cooked with water instead of oil!
Address: #02-17/18 Concorde Hotel Singapore, 100 Orchard Road, S(238840)
 
7. Ayam Penyet Ria
 

Damage: $7.90
The Ayam Penyet ($7.90) was a mouth-watering sight - crumbs everywhere! Throughout the whole meal, I was that ridiculous emoji with heart shapes for eyes.  
The chefs mastered the art of deep-frying chicken - the skin was crispy but the thigh meat was still moist. It’s sinful but worth every calorie. You must order a drink because the chili was so intense, my tongue burned all the way from Lucky Plaza to Far East Plaza. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #04-25, S(238863)
 
8. Pies & Coffee
 
Source
Damage: $6
If you love a pie but hate the mess of having it to-go, dine in at Pies & Coffee! With a menu that carries both sweet and savory pies priced between $6-12, it’s an ideal spot for a meal or snack. Savory pies are served with a side of mashed potatoes and salad greens. 
Address: The Centrepoint, 176 Orchard Road, #01-101-104, S(238843)  
 
9. Yonehachi 
 

Damage: $7.80
Meet Okowa rice, cousin of Lo Mai Kai,  only less greasy and of a Japanese descent. Each mouthful of the Salmon Okowa Rice Set ($7.80) was wholesome and tasty, best enjoyed with the side of pickles. This set comes in 4 other flavors and suit small to moderate eaters best. Go for the larger set meals with Unagi or Chicken Teriyaki if you’d like something more substantial. 
Tip: If you don’t have time to dine in, takeaway options are available too! 
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-1/2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
10. New Station Snack Bar
 

Damage: $6
This zi char shop is usually crowded and cramped, but discomfort is a small price to pay for my Salted Egg Pork Ribs Rice ($6). The pork ribs are soft and the salted egg sauce was easily the highlight of the dish. The curry leaves and chili padi gave it a tinge of spiciness, so it was creamy without being overly jelat. 
Tip: This dish is only on the Chinese menu so if you can’t read those characters to save your life, it’s No. 6. You’re welcome. 
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-95, S(228213)
 
11. Smoothie King 
 
Source
Damage: $6-7
On days when I’m feeling healthy, I try to avoid eye contact with the bubble tea shop and go to Smoothie King instead, where my first smoothie won half my heart just by being pastel-colored. 
A smoothie easily cost about $6-7, but the $9.90 set meal gets you an additional wrap or salad. It’s a triumph to score a meal in Orchard for $10, but to have it for under 500 calories is pure win! 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #01-14/15, S(238895)
 
12. Riverside Indonesian BBQ
 
Source
Damage: $6
Fans of the famous Indonesian BBQ Store in Plaza Singapura Kopitiam will be excited to know that 313 Somerset and Ion Orchard are homes to 2 other branches. With a specialty in the Ayam Panggang, the shop is known for using only fresh chicken.
After machine-dipping it into their signature black sauce, it’s served with steamed rice and topped with coconut curry. Most dishes, including squid and fish cooked with the same technique, cost around $6 on average. 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-44, S(238895)
 
13. Thai Tantric
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
Most people flock to Jane Thai at Orchard Towers, but its opening hours (evening only) are a real bummer. Thai Tantric’s opening hours (11am-3pm, 6pm-3am) are friendlier because no lust for Thai food should go unsatisfied. 
Popular dishes include Phad Thai ($6.50), Tom Yum Seafood Soup ($10) and Fried Glass Noodles with Seafood ($7), while most side dishes are priced below $10. Orchard Towers may not be the most pristine mall around, but great prices and authenticity rarely reside in upscale grounds and polished walls. 
Address: Orchard Towers, 400 Orchard Road, #03-23, S(238875)
 
14. Astons Specialities
 
Source
Damage: $6.90
Astons Specialties is a restaurant that requires no introduction, and one of the few I find worth queueing for. Apart from the steaks and chops, most pastas, burgers and fish dishes go for below $10. I love the flexibility in selecting sides, though I always find myself ending up with Mac & Cheese and Garden Vegetables. 
Address: #03-04 *SCAPE, 2 Orchard Link, S(237978)
 
15. Gyoza-Ya
 


Damage: $6.50
The Pan-fried Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had perfect skin - thin, crispy, and not too greasy. The chives and vegetable bits added texture to the sweet and soft pork filling. On the other hand, the Steamed Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had a soft and luscious exterior, served with their house special sauce. I personally preferred the former as I found the sauce to be a little too salty.  
This little-known place is ambient and surprisingly affordable. Sides are priced between $3.80-6.80, while mains cost $6.50-$6.80. It’s Robinsons’ well-kept secret!
Address: Robinsons Heeren, 260 Orchard Road, #B1-02A, S(238855)
 
16. River Valley Nasi Lemak 
 

Damage: $3.80
The cheapest of the lot is found at $3.80 at a remote corner of Lucky Plaza’s basement. I love the rice and chili best - foundation of any Nasi Lemak. The rice was some of the most fragrant I’ve tasted - each bite flavorful with coconut milk, perfect when paired with the sambal chili. The sides tasted average at best, but the variety is well worth the price. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #B1-99/101, S(238863)
 
17. Quiznos  
 

Damage: $6.90
As I unwrapped it my 6-inch Classic Italian Sub ($6.90), I judged it a little; it wasn’t the most good-looking sandwich. But the misunderstood sub soon redeemed itself.
The freshly toasted Rosemary Parmesan bread was so good it can be eaten on its own, appetizing with its aroma of herb and cheese combined. It would be perfect if the vegetables were fresher and crunchier, but the meats made up for it. Topped with mozzarella and red wine vinaigrette, the deli meats (pepperoni, salami, capicola and ham) were juicier and tastier than that of any other sub!
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #03-31, S(238896)
 
18. Jtown Cafe
 
SourceSource
Damage: Under $8
Jtown is an eatery located at the basement of Midpoint Orchard that serves Indonesian delicacies. Mains like the Bakmie Aya Bakso (pictured above) and the Black Pepper Bakso, which seems like the Indonesian version of Jajamen will cost you no more than $8, complete with a drink. There’s a variety of interesting Murtabak as well, with flavors like cheese, chocolate and even durian.
Address:#B1-04/05 Midpoint Orchard, 220 Orchard Road, S(238852)
 
19. Eighteen Chefs 
 
Source
Damage: $6.40
Back when I was in school, 18 Chefs was a regular hangout. Today, the menu has grown about 3 times more extensive, but the student meal still costs $6.40 - a price I remember to be constant throughout these years. Even if you’re not a student, the “Be Your Own Chef” option remains a highly popular and customizable classic for baked rice and pastas below $10.
Address: #04-02 Cineleisure Orchard, 8 Grange Road, S(239695)
 
20. Central Hong Kong Cafe
 
Source
Damage: Under $10.
Unlike most Hong Kong cafes, this shop makes you stop in your tracks to admire the furnishing. With patterned tiles and grilles, old school celebrity posters and a soundtrack made up of Cantonese oldies, it’s clear that a lot of thought went into the creating an ambience. As most of the popular street food such as egg noodles and specialty toasts are priced affordably, you can easily dine for less than $10.
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #02-30, S(238896)
 
21. Greenview Cafe
 

Damage: $4.50
In different shapes and sizes, the Mee Hoon Kueh Dry ($4.50) at Greenview Cafe is handmade, unlike the identical machine-cut squares sold at food courts. The thicker slices may not be for everyone, but I personally loved the Q-ness. The prawns (with an alternative of minced pork) were fresh and crisp while the sauce was the right amounts of sweet and salty, making this a favorite comfort food accessible in town. 
Address: Far East Plaza, 14 Scotts Road, #04-96, S(228213)
 
22. Gyoza no Ohsho

Ohsho is a Japanese casual dining joint located in Cuppage Plaza, within walking distance of Somerset MRT. In spite of its small size, the menu is quite extensive.

Cheap Food In Orchard Road 
 
Noble quests have always faced skepticism. 
Prior to my hunt for meals below $10 in Orchard Road, I surveyed my friends. Some looked at me as if I had just suggested we pool our savings to buy a unicorn. “Siao ah, this is Singapore babe”, they reminded me. One guy suggested McDonald’s. Oh, pure and utter audacity. 
Remember the days when Chicken Rice was $1? Me neither, but my parents would. Contrary to popular belief and common Singapore complaints, it’s possible to dine in Orchard Road without burning a hole in your pocket.
Here are 18 wallet-friendly meals you never knew about. 
 
1. Shi Li Fang Hotpot
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
At a price of $9.90++, choose from the Beef Tenderloin, Special Fish Head, Specialty Chicken/Pork Tenderloin, Pork Belly, Mushroom or Vegetables lunchtime (till 4pm) set meals. Each meal comes with a vegetables platter and a choice of handmade/egg noodles, rice or vermicelli. Also, every hotpot is personal so you reserve all rights to pick that soup base all your friends hate!
The total bill should come up to about $12 after tax, but what’s an extra few dollars when most hotpot restaurants in Orchard Road cost at least $30?
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #07-10/11, S(238896)
 
2. Tsuru-Koshi Udon
 

Damage: $10
From a selection of Udon and Donburi below $14, I ordered the Ebi Tempura Udon ($10). The soup was slightly salty without being overwhelming. The Udon was silky and smooth as promised when enjoyed with the Onsen Egg ($1). Though I would like my tempura to be crispier, this is the go-to place when you’re craving something hot and soupy. Many patrons are Japanese themselves!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B201-3, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
3. Hainanese Delicacy 
 

Damage: $4
I seriously suspect that I’m the only noob who has never tried this. I don’t care that it’s been reviewed to death! I need to gush about it once more to get it out of my system. 
Even though it was lunchtime, the line at Hainanese Delicacy moved quickly. I loved that the boneless meat of the Roasted Chicken Rice ($4) fully captured the sauce’s essence in its tender goodness, but it was the chilli that won me over. I don’t wanna jinx it, but this may be the best I’ve had.
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-116, S(228213)
 
4. Fisherios 
 

Damage: $7.90
Fisherios at Takashimaya Food Basement is hard to miss - with its inviting display of oysters and the smell of freshly fried fish. With a specialty in the Beer Battered Fish & Chips ($7.90), other house specials include Breaded fish ($8.90), Snapper ($9.90), Salmon ($9.90), and Shrimp ($8.90). This puts an end to paying $20 for a plate of fish & chips!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-4-2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
5. Dong Dae Mun
 

Damage: Sticks of meat from $1
Dong Dae Mun at Somerset 313 is the only outlet islandwide that serves meals like Kimchi Fried Rice and Korean Ramyun, within a dining space that fits about 12 people. 
The tantalising sight of sauce sizzling on the hot plate didn’t disappoint. Even though the chicken slices were thin, the portion was fairly large and well worth the money.
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-49, S(238895)
 
6. Kim Dae Mun
 
Source
Damage: Under $8
Further down the road is another Korean food spot to check out on the second floor of Concorde Hotel. There’s often a long queue in spite of its remote location, and it isn’t difficult to see why. Set meals and side dishes are priced below $8, and patrons have raved about the prices and authenticity.
Also, rumor has it that the hotplate items are cooked with water instead of oil!
Address: #02-17/18 Concorde Hotel Singapore, 100 Orchard Road, S(238840)
 
7. Ayam Penyet Ria
 

Damage: $7.90
The Ayam Penyet ($7.90) was a mouth-watering sight - crumbs everywhere! Throughout the whole meal, I was that ridiculous emoji with heart shapes for eyes.  
The chefs mastered the art of deep-frying chicken - the skin was crispy but the thigh meat was still moist. It’s sinful but worth every calorie. You must order a drink because the chili was so intense, my tongue burned all the way from Lucky Plaza to Far East Plaza. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #04-25, S(238863)
 
8. Pies & Coffee
 
Source
Damage: $6
If you love a pie but hate the mess of having it to-go, dine in at Pies & Coffee! With a menu that carries both sweet and savory pies priced between $6-12, it’s an ideal spot for a meal or snack. Savory pies are served with a side of mashed potatoes and salad greens. 
Address: The Centrepoint, 176 Orchard Road, #01-101-104, S(238843)  
 
9. Yonehachi 
 

Damage: $7.80
Meet Okowa rice, cousin of Lo Mai Kai,  only less greasy and of a Japanese descent. Each mouthful of the Salmon Okowa Rice Set ($7.80) was wholesome and tasty, best enjoyed with the side of pickles. This set comes in 4 other flavors and suit small to moderate eaters best. Go for the larger set meals with Unagi or Chicken Teriyaki if you’d like something more substantial. 
Tip: If you don’t have time to dine in, takeaway options are available too! 
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-1/2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
10. New Station Snack Bar
 

Damage: $6
This zi char shop is usually crowded and cramped, but discomfort is a small price to pay for my Salted Egg Pork Ribs Rice ($6). The pork ribs are soft and the salted egg sauce was easily the highlight of the dish. The curry leaves and chili padi gave it a tinge of spiciness, so it was creamy without being overly jelat. 
Tip: This dish is only on the Chinese menu so if you can’t read those characters to save your life, it’s No. 6. You’re welcome. 
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-95, S(228213)
 
11. Smoothie King 
 
Source
Damage: $6-7
On days when I’m feeling healthy, I try to avoid eye contact with the bubble tea shop and go to Smoothie King instead, where my first smoothie won half my heart just by being pastel-colored. 
A smoothie easily cost about $6-7, but the $9.90 set meal gets you an additional wrap or salad. It’s a triumph to score a meal in Orchard for $10, but to have it for under 500 calories is pure win! 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #01-14/15, S(238895)
 
12. Riverside Indonesian BBQ
 
Source
Damage: $6
Fans of the famous Indonesian BBQ Store in Plaza Singapura Kopitiam will be excited to know that 313 Somerset and Ion Orchard are homes to 2 other branches. With a specialty in the Ayam Panggang, the shop is known for using only fresh chicken.
After machine-dipping it into their signature black sauce, it’s served with steamed rice and topped with coconut curry. Most dishes, including squid and fish cooked with the same technique, cost around $6 on average. 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-44, S(238895)
 
13. Thai Tantric
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
Most people flock to Jane Thai at Orchard Towers, but its opening hours (evening only) are a real bummer. Thai Tantric’s opening hours (11am-3pm, 6pm-3am) are friendlier because no lust for Thai food should go unsatisfied. 
Popular dishes include Phad Thai ($6.50), Tom Yum Seafood Soup ($10) and Fried Glass Noodles with Seafood ($7), while most side dishes are priced below $10. Orchard Towers may not be the most pristine mall around, but great prices and authenticity rarely reside in upscale grounds and polished walls. 
Address: Orchard Towers, 400 Orchard Road, #03-23, S(238875)
 
14. Astons Specialities
 
Source
Damage: $6.90
Astons Specialties is a restaurant that requires no introduction, and one of the few I find worth queueing for. Apart from the steaks and chops, most pastas, burgers and fish dishes go for below $10. I love the flexibility in selecting sides, though I always find myself ending up with Mac & Cheese and Garden Vegetables. 
Address: #03-04 *SCAPE, 2 Orchard Link, S(237978)
 
15. Gyoza-Ya
 


Damage: $6.50
The Pan-fried Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had perfect skin - thin, crispy, and not too greasy. The chives and vegetable bits added texture to the sweet and soft pork filling. On the other hand, the Steamed Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had a soft and luscious exterior, served with their house special sauce. I personally preferred the former as I found the sauce to be a little too salty.  
This little-known place is ambient and surprisingly affordable. Sides are priced between $3.80-6.80, while mains cost $6.50-$6.80. It’s Robinsons’ well-kept secret!
Address: Robinsons Heeren, 260 Orchard Road, #B1-02A, S(238855)
 
16. River Valley Nasi Lemak 
 

Damage: $3.80
The cheapest of the lot is found at $3.80 at a remote corner of Lucky Plaza’s basement. I love the rice and chili best - foundation of any Nasi Lemak. The rice was some of the most fragrant I’ve tasted - each bite flavorful with coconut milk, perfect when paired with the sambal chili. The sides tasted average at best, but the variety is well worth the price. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #B1-99/101, S(238863)
 
17. Quiznos  
 

Damage: $6.90
As I unwrapped it my 6-inch Classic Italian Sub ($6.90), I judged it a little; it wasn’t the most good-looking sandwich. But the misunderstood sub soon redeemed itself.
The freshly toasted Rosemary Parmesan bread was so good it can be eaten on its own, appetizing with its aroma of herb and cheese combined. It would be perfect if the vegetables were fresher and crunchier, but the meats made up for it. Topped with mozzarella and red wine vinaigrette, the deli meats (pepperoni, salami, capicola and ham) were juicier and tastier than that of any other sub!
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #03-31, S(238896)
 
18. Jtown Cafe
 
SourceSource
Damage: Under $8
Jtown is an eatery located at the basement of Midpoint Orchard that serves Indonesian delicacies. Mains like the Bakmie Aya Bakso (pictured above) and the Black Pepper Bakso, which seems like the Indonesian version of Jajamen will cost you no more than $8, complete with a drink. There’s a variety of interesting Murtabak as well, with flavors like cheese, chocolate and even durian.
Address:#B1-04/05 Midpoint Orchard, 220 Orchard Road, S(238852)
 
19. Eighteen Chefs 
 
Source
Damage: $6.40
Back when I was in school, 18 Chefs was a regular hangout. Today, the menu has grown about 3 times more extensive, but the student meal still costs $6.40 - a price I remember to be constant throughout these years. Even if you’re not a student, the “Be Your Own Chef” option remains a highly popular and customizable classic for baked rice and pastas below $10.
Address: #04-02 Cineleisure Orchard, 8 Grange Road, S(239695)
 
20. Central Hong Kong Cafe
 
Source
Damage: Under $10.
Unlike most Hong Kong cafes, this shop makes you stop in your tracks to admire the furnishing. With patterned tiles and grilles, old school celebrity posters and a soundtrack made up of Cantonese oldies, it’s clear that a lot of thought went into the creating an ambience. As most of the popular street food such as egg noodles and specialty toasts are priced affordably, you can easily dine for less than $10.
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #02-30, S(238896)
 
21. Greenview Cafe
 

Damage: $4.50
In different shapes and sizes, the Mee Hoon Kueh Dry ($4.50) at Greenview Cafe is handmade, unlike the identical machine-cut squares sold at food courts. The thicker slices may not be for everyone, but I personally loved the Q-ness. The prawns (with an alternative of minced pork) were fresh and crisp while the sauce was the right amounts of sweet and salty, making this a favorite comfort food accessible in town. 
Address: Far East Plaza, 14 Scotts Road, #04-96, S(228213)
 
22. Gyoza no Ohsho
 
Source
Damage: $10
Ohsho is a Japanese casual dining joint located in Cuppage Plaza, within walking distance of Somerset MRT. In spite of its small size, the menu is quite extensive. Ramen here starts from $11, but for less than $10, you’d be able to get Yakiudon or Yakisoba, and a selection of rice dishes. For more value, look out for the set meals they offer!
Address: #01-10 Cuppage Plaza, 5 Koek Road, S(228796)
 
Bonus: Espuma Lab 
 
Source
Here’s something extra for those who’re willing to walk for cheap food. Which should mean everyone. 
Espuma Lab in PoMo features Michelin-style culinary methods like Espuma (foam) and Sous Vide (thermal circulator). Those are interesting techniques to pay attention to if you aren’t distracted by the prices yet.
Main courses are unbelievably priced at - get this - $6.80! Top-ups for a drink and a bowl of soup cost only $2. If you’re an all-day breakfast fanatic, this place also makes poached eggs with a side of Norwegian Salmon or Sauteed Mushrooms for less than $5!
Address: 1 Selegie Road, #01-20/21, PoMo,  S(188306)
 
Busting the Myth
 
There are many different ways people spend $10 in town these days. Some buy a Venti beverage because Starbucks’ Christmas Drinks can take all their money, while others join a froyo queue so long a security guard is stationed to manage it. 
If you can no longer enjoy the privilege of flashing your student card, it’s unlikely that $10 will get you much in today’s economy. We hope this article has helped you discover more choices in every nook and cranny of Orchard Road!
In fact, if you’re savvy enough, you may even have money left for dessert: Source

Here are 18 wallet-friendly meals you never knew about. 
 
1. Shi Li Fang Hotpot
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
At a price of $9.90++, choose from the Beef Tenderloin, Special Fish Head, Specialty Chicken/Pork Tenderloin, Pork Belly, Mushroom or Vegetables lunchtime (till 4pm) set meals. Each meal comes with a vegetables platter and a choice of handmade/egg noodles, rice or vermicelli. Also, every hotpot is personal so you reserve all rights to pick that soup base all your friends hate!
The total bill should come up to about $12 after tax, but what’s an extra few dollars when most hotpot restaurants in Orchard Road cost at least $30?
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #07-10/11, S(238896)
 
2. Tsuru-Koshi Udon
 

Damage: $10
From a selection of Udon and Donburi below $14, I ordered the Ebi Tempura Udon ($10). The soup was slightly salty without being overwhelming. The Udon was silky and smooth as promised when enjoyed with the Onsen Egg ($1). Though I would like my tempura to be crispier, this is the go-to place when you’re craving something hot and soupy. Many patrons are Japanese themselves!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B201-3, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
3. Hainanese Delicacy 
 

Damage: $4
I seriously suspect that I’m the only noob who has never tried this. I don’t care that it’s been reviewed to death! I need to gush about it once more to get it out of my system. 
Even though it was lunchtime, the line at Hainanese Delicacy moved quickly. I loved that the boneless meat of the Roasted Chicken Rice ($4) fully captured the sauce’s essence in its tender goodness, but it was the chilli that won me over. I don’t wanna jinx it, but this may be the best I’ve had.
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-116, S(228213)
 
4. Fisherios 
 

Damage: $7.90
Fisherios at Takashimaya Food Basement is hard to miss - with its inviting display of oysters and the smell of freshly fried fish. With a specialty in the Beer Battered Fish & Chips ($7.90), other house specials include Breaded fish ($8.90), Snapper ($9.90), Salmon ($9.90), and Shrimp ($8.90). This puts an end to paying $20 for a plate of fish & chips!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-4-2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
5. Dong Dae Mun
 

Damage: Sticks of meat from $1
Dong Dae Mun at Somerset 313 is the only outlet islandwide that serves meals like Kimchi Fried Rice and Korean Ramyun, within a dining space that fits about 12 people. 
The tantalising sight of sauce sizzling on the hot plate didn’t disappoint. Even though the chicken slices were thin, the portion was fairly large and well worth the money.
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-49, S(238895)
 
6. Kim Dae Mun
 
Source
Damage: Under $8
Further down the road is another Korean food spot to check out on the second floor of Concorde Hotel. There’s often a long queue in spite of its remote location, and it isn’t difficult to see why. Set meals and side dishes are priced below $8, and patrons have raved about the prices and authenticity.
Also, rumor has it that the hotplate items are cooked with water instead of oil!
Address: #02-17/18 Concorde Hotel Singapore, 100 Orchard Road, S(238840)
 
7. Ayam Penyet Ria
 

Damage: $7.90
The Ayam Penyet ($7.90) was a mouth-watering sight - crumbs everywhere! Throughout the whole meal, I was that ridiculous emoji with heart shapes for eyes.  
The chefs mastered the art of deep-frying chicken - the skin was crispy but the thigh meat was still moist. It’s sinful but worth every calorie. You must order a drink because the chili was so intense, my tongue burned all the way from Lucky Plaza to Far East Plaza. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #04-25, S(238863)
 
8. Pies & Coffee
 
Source
Damage: $6
If you love a pie but hate the mess of having it to-go, dine in at Pies & Coffee! With a menu that carries both sweet and savory pies priced between $6-12, it’s an ideal spot for a meal or snack. Savory pies are served with a side of mashed potatoes and salad greens. 
Address: The Centrepoint, 176 Orchard Road, #01-101-104, S(238843)  
 
9. Yonehachi 
 

Damage: $7.80
Meet Okowa rice, cousin of Lo Mai Kai,  only less greasy and of a Japanese descent. Each mouthful of the Salmon Okowa Rice Set ($7.80) was wholesome and tasty, best enjoyed with the side of pickles. This set comes in 4 other flavors and suit small to moderate eaters best. Go for the larger set meals with Unagi or Chicken Teriyaki if you’d like something more substantial. 
Tip: If you don’t have time to dine in, takeaway options are available too! 
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-1/2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
10. New Station Snack Bar
 

Damage: $6
This zi char shop is usually crowded and cramped, but discomfort is a small price to pay for my Salted Egg Pork Ribs Rice ($6). The pork ribs are soft and the salted egg sauce was easily the highlight of the dish. The curry leaves and chili padi gave it a tinge of spiciness, so it was creamy without being overly jelat. 
Tip: This dish is only on the Chinese menu so if you can’t read those characters to save your life, it’s No. 6. You’re welcome. 
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-95, S(228213)
 
11. Smoothie King 
 
Source
Damage: $6-7
On days when I’m feeling healthy, I try to avoid eye contact with the bubble tea shop and go to Smoothie King instead, where my first smoothie won half my heart just by being pastel-colored. 
A smoothie easily cost about $6-7, but the $9.90 set meal gets you an additional wrap or salad. It’s a triumph to score a meal in Orchard for $10, but to have it for under 500 calories is pure win! 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #01-14/15, S(238895)
 
12. Riverside Indonesian BBQ
 
Source
Damage: $6
Fans of the famous Indonesian BBQ Store in Plaza Singapura Kopitiam will be excited to know that 313 Somerset and Ion Orchard are homes to 2 other branches. With a specialty in the Ayam Panggang, the shop is known for using only fresh chicken.
After machine-dipping it into their signature black sauce, it’s served with steamed rice and topped with coconut curry. Most dishes, including squid and fish cooked with the same technique, cost around $6 on average. 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-44, S(238895)
 
13. Thai Tantric
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
Most people flock to Jane Thai at Orchard Towers, but its opening hours (evening only) are a real bummer. Thai Tantric’s opening hours (11am-3pm, 6pm-3am) are friendlier because no lust for Thai food should go unsatisfied. 
Popular dishes include Phad Thai ($6.50), Tom Yum Seafood Soup ($10) and Fried Glass Noodles with Seafood ($7), while most side dishes are priced below $10. Orchard Towers may not be the most pristine mall around, but great prices and authenticity rarely reside in upscale grounds and polished walls. 
Address: Orchard Towers, 400 Orchard Road, #03-23, S(238875)
 
14. Astons Specialities
 
Source
Damage: $6.90
Astons Specialties is a restaurant that requires no introduction, and one of the few I find worth queueing for. Apart from the steaks and chops, most pastas, burgers and fish dishes go for below $10. I love the flexibility in selecting sides, though I always find myself ending up with Mac & Cheese and Garden Vegetables. 
Address: #03-04 *SCAPE, 2 Orchard Link, S(237978)
 
15. Gyoza-Ya
 


Damage: $6.50
The Pan-fried Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had perfect skin - thin, crispy, and not too greasy. The chives and vegetable bits added texture to the sweet and soft pork filling. On the other hand, the Steamed Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had a soft and luscious exterior, served with their house special sauce. I personally preferred the former as I found the sauce to be a little too salty.  
This little-known place is ambient and surprisingly affordable. Sides are priced between $3.80-6.80, while mains cost $6.50-$6.80. It’s Robinsons’ well-kept secret!
Address: Robinsons Heeren, 260 Orchard Road, #B1-02A, S(238855)
 
16. River Valley Nasi Lemak 
 

Damage: $3.80
The cheapest of the lot is found at $3.80 at a remote corner of Lucky Plaza’s basement. I love the rice and chili best - foundation of any Nasi Lemak. The rice was some of the most fragrant I’ve tasted - each bite flavorful with coconut milk, perfect when paired with the sambal chili. The sides tasted average at best, but the variety is well worth the price. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #B1-99/101, S(238863)
 
17. Quiznos  
 

Damage: $6.90
As I unwrapped it my 6-inch Classic Italian Sub ($6.90), I judged it a little; it wasn’t the most good-looking sandwich. But the misunderstood sub soon redeemed itself.
The freshly toasted Rosemary Parmesan bread was so good it can be eaten on its own, appetizing with its aroma of herb and cheese combined. It would be perfect if the vegetables were fresher and crunchier, but the meats made up for it. Topped with mozzarella and red wine vinaigrette, the deli meats (pepperoni, salami, capicola and ham) were juicier and tastier than that of any other sub!
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #03-31, S(238896)
 
18. Jtown Cafe
 
SourceSource
Damage: Under $8
Jtown is an eatery located at the basement of Midpoint Orchard that serves Indonesian delicacies. Mains like the Bakmie Aya Bakso (pictured above) and the Black Pepper Bakso, which seems like the Indonesian version of Jajamen will cost you no more than $8, complete with a drink. There’s a variety of interesting Murtabak as well, with flavors like cheese, chocolate and even durian.
Address:#B1-04/05 Midpoint Orchard, 220 Orchard Road, S(238852)
 
19. Eighteen Chefs 
 
Source
Damage: $6.40
Back when I was in school, 18 Chefs was a regular hangout. Today, the menu has grown about 3 times more extensive, but the student meal still costs $6.40 - a price I remember to be constant throughout these years. Even if you’re not a student, the “Be Your Own Chef” option remains a highly popular and customizable classic for baked rice and pastas below $10.
Address: #04-02 Cineleisure Orchard, 8 Grange Road, S(239695)
 
20. Central Hong Kong Cafe
 
Source
Damage: Under $10.
Unlike most Hong Kong cafes, this shop makes you stop in your tracks to admire the furnishing. With patterned tiles and grilles, old school celebrity posters and a soundtrack made up of Cantonese oldies, it’s clear that a lot of thought went into the creating an ambience. As most of the popular street food such as egg noodles and specialty toasts are priced affordably, you can easily dine for less than $10.
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #02-30, S(238896)
 
21. Greenview Cafe
 

Damage: $4.50
In different shapes and sizes, the Mee Hoon Kueh Dry ($4.50) at Greenview Cafe is handmade, unlike the identical machine-cut squares sold at food courts. The thicker slices may not be for everyone, but I personally loved the Q-ness. The prawns (with an alternative of minced pork) were fresh and crisp while the sauce was the right amounts of sweet and salty, making this a favorite comfort food accessible in town. 
Address: Far East Plaza, 14 Scotts Road, #04-96, S(228213)
 
22. Gyoza no Ohsho
 
Source
Damage: $10
Ohsho is a Japanese casual dining joint located in Cuppage Plaza, within walking distance of Somerset MRT. In spite of its small size, the menu is quite extensive. Ramen here starts from $11, but for less than $10, you’d be able to get Yakiudon or Yakisoba, and a selection of rice dishes. For more value, look out for the set meals they offer!
Address: #01-10 Cuppage Plaza, 5 Koek Road, S(228796)
 
Bonus: Espuma Lab 
 
Source
Here’s something extra for those who’re willing to walk for cheap food. Which should mean everyone. 
Espuma Lab in PoMo features Michelin-style culinary methods like Espuma (foam) and Sous Vide (thermal circulator). Those are interesting techniques to pay attention to if you aren’t distracted by the prices yet.
Main courses are unbelievably priced at - get this - $6.80! Top-ups for a drink and a bowl of soup cost only $2. If you’re an all-day breakfast fanatic, this place also makes poached eggs with a side of Norwegian Salmon or Sauteed Mushrooms for less than $5!
Address: 1 Selegie Road, #01-20/21, PoMo,  S(188306)
 
Busting the Myth
 
There are many different ways people spend $10 in town these days. Some buy a Venti beverage because Starbucks’ Christmas Drinks can take all their money, while others join a froyo queue so long a security guard is stationed to manage it. 
If you can no longer enjoy the privilege of flashing your student card, it’s unlikely that $10 will get you much in today’s economy. We hope this article has helped you discover more choices in every nook and cranny of Orchard Road!
In fact, if you’re savvy enough, you may even have money left for dessert: Source

Cheap Food In Orchard Road 
 
Noble quests have always faced skepticism. 
Prior to my hunt for meals below $10 in Orchard Road, I surveyed my friends. Some looked at me as if I had just suggested we pool our savings to buy a unicorn. “Siao ah, this is Singapore babe”, they reminded me. One guy suggested McDonald’s. Oh, pure and utter audacity.

The prawns (with an alternative of minced pork) were fresh and crisp while the sauce was the right amounts of sweet and salty, making this a favorite comfort food accessible in town.

22. Gyoza no Ohsho
 
Source
Damage: $10
Ohsho is a Japanese casual dining joint located in Cuppage Plaza, within walking distance of Somerset MRT. In spite of its small size, the menu is quite extensive. Ramen here starts from $11, but for less than $10, you’d be able to get Yakiudon or Yakisoba, and a selection of rice dishes. For more value, look out for the set meals they offer!
Address: #01-10 Cuppage Plaza, 5 Koek Road, S(228796)
 
Bonus: Espuma Lab 
 
Source
Here’s something extra for those who’re willing to walk for cheap food. Which should mean everyone. 
Espuma Lab in PoMo features Michelin-style culinary methods like Espuma (foam) and Sous Vide (thermal circulator). Those are interesting techniques to pay attention to if you aren’t distracted by the prices yet.
Main courses are unbelievably priced at - get this - $6.80! Top-ups for a drink and a bowl of soup cost only $2. If you’re an all-day breakfast fanatic, this place also makes poached eggs with a side of Norwegian Salmon or Sauteed Mushrooms for less than $5!
Address: 1 Selegie Road, #01-20/21, PoMo,  S(188306)
 
Busting the Myth
 
There are many different ways people spend $10 in town these days. Some buy a Venti beverage because Starbucks’ Christmas Drinks can take all their money, while others join a froyo queue so long a security guard is stationed to manage it. 
If you can no longer enjoy the privilege of flashing your student card, it’s unlikely that $10 will get you much in today’s economy. We hope this article has helped you discover more choices in every nook and cranny of Orchard Road!
In fact, if you’re savvy enough, you may even have money left for dessert: Source

Cheap Food In Orchard Road 
 
Noble quests have always faced skepticism. 
Prior to my hunt for meals below $10 in Orchard Road, I surveyed my friends. Some looked at me as if I had just suggested we pool our savings to buy a unicorn. “Siao ah, this is Singapore babe”, they reminded me. One guy suggested McDonald’s. Oh, pure and utter audacity. 
Remember the days when Chicken Rice was $1? Me neither, but my parents would. Contrary to popular belief and common Singapore complaints, it’s possible to dine in Orchard Road without burning a hole in your pocket.
Here are 18 wallet-friendly meals you never knew about. 
 
1. Shi Li Fang Hotpot
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
At a price of $9.90++, choose from the Beef Tenderloin, Special Fish Head, Specialty Chicken/Pork Tenderloin, Pork Belly, Mushroom or Vegetables lunchtime (till 4pm) set meals. Each meal comes with a vegetables platter and a choice of handmade/egg noodles, rice or vermicelli. Also, every hotpot is personal so you reserve all rights to pick that soup base all your friends hate!
The total bill should come up to about $12 after tax, but what’s an extra few dollars when most hotpot restaurants in Orchard Road cost at least $30?
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #07-10/11, S(238896)
 
2. Tsuru-Koshi Udon
 

Damage: $10
From a selection of Udon and Donburi below $14, I ordered the Ebi Tempura Udon ($10). The soup was slightly salty without being overwhelming. The Udon was silky and smooth as promised when enjoyed with the Onsen Egg ($1). Though I would like my tempura to be crispier, this is the go-to place when you’re craving something hot and soupy. Many patrons are Japanese themselves!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B201-3, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
3. Hainanese Delicacy 
 

Damage: $4
I seriously suspect that I’m the only noob who has never tried this. I don’t care that it’s been reviewed to death! I need to gush about it once more to get it out of my system. 
Even though it was lunchtime, the line at Hainanese Delicacy moved quickly. I loved that the boneless meat of the Roasted Chicken Rice ($4) fully captured the sauce’s essence in its tender goodness, but it was the chilli that won me over. I don’t wanna jinx it, but this may be the best I’ve had.
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-116, S(228213)
 
4. Fisherios 
 

Damage: $7.90
Fisherios at Takashimaya Food Basement is hard to miss - with its inviting display of oysters and the smell of freshly fried fish. With a specialty in the Beer Battered Fish & Chips ($7.90), other house specials include Breaded fish ($8.90), Snapper ($9.90), Salmon ($9.90), and Shrimp ($8.90). This puts an end to paying $20 for a plate of fish & chips!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-4-2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
5. Dong Dae Mun
 

Damage: Sticks of meat from $1
Dong Dae Mun at Somerset 313 is the only outlet islandwide that serves meals like Kimchi Fried Rice and Korean Ramyun, within a dining space that fits about 12 people. 
The tantalising sight of sauce sizzling on the hot plate didn’t disappoint. Even though the chicken slices were thin, the portion was fairly large and well worth the money.
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-49, S(238895)
 
6. Kim Dae Mun
 
Source
Damage: Under $8
Further down the road is another Korean food spot to check out on the second floor of Concorde Hotel. There’s often a long queue in spite of its remote location, and it isn’t difficult to see why. Set meals and side dishes are priced below $8, and patrons have raved about the prices and authenticity.
Also, rumor has it that the hotplate items are cooked with water instead of oil!
Address: #02-17/18 Concorde Hotel Singapore, 100 Orchard Road, S(238840)
 
7. Ayam Penyet Ria
 

Damage: $7.90
The Ayam Penyet ($7.90) was a mouth-watering sight - crumbs everywhere! Throughout the whole meal, I was that ridiculous emoji with heart shapes for eyes.  
The chefs mastered the art of deep-frying chicken - the skin was crispy but the thigh meat was still moist. It’s sinful but worth every calorie. You must order a drink because the chili was so intense, my tongue burned all the way from Lucky Plaza to Far East Plaza. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #04-25, S(238863)
 
8. Pies & Coffee
 
Source
Damage: $6
If you love a pie but hate the mess of having it to-go, dine in at Pies & Coffee! With a menu that carries both sweet and savory pies priced between $6-12, it’s an ideal spot for a meal or snack. Savory pies are served with a side of mashed potatoes and salad greens. 
Address: The Centrepoint, 176 Orchard Road, #01-101-104, S(238843)  
 
9. Yonehachi 
 

Damage: $7.80
Meet Okowa rice, cousin of Lo Mai Kai,  only less greasy and of a Japanese descent. Each mouthful of the Salmon Okowa Rice Set ($7.80) was wholesome and tasty, best enjoyed with the side of pickles. This set comes in 4 other flavors and suit small to moderate eaters best. Go for the larger set meals with Unagi or Chicken Teriyaki if you’d like something more substantial. 
Tip: If you don’t have time to dine in, takeaway options are available too! 
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-1/2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
10. New Station Snack Bar
 

Damage: $6
This zi char shop is usually crowded and cramped, but discomfort is a small price to pay for my Salted Egg Pork Ribs Rice ($6). The pork ribs are soft and the salted egg sauce was easily the highlight of the dish. The curry leaves and chili padi gave it a tinge of spiciness, so it was creamy without being overly jelat. 
Tip: This dish is only on the Chinese menu so if you can’t read those characters to save your life, it’s No. 6. You’re welcome. 
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-95, S(228213)
 
11. Smoothie King 
 
Source
Damage: $6-7
On days when I’m feeling healthy, I try to avoid eye contact with the bubble tea shop and go to Smoothie King instead, where my first smoothie won half my heart just by being pastel-colored. 
A smoothie easily cost about $6-7, but the $9.90 set meal gets you an additional wrap or salad. It’s a triumph to score a meal in Orchard for $10, but to have it for under 500 calories is pure win! 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #01-14/15, S(238895)
 
12. Riverside Indonesian BBQ
 
Source
Damage: $6
Fans of the famous Indonesian BBQ Store in Plaza Singapura Kopitiam will be excited to know that 313 Somerset and Ion Orchard are homes to 2 other branches. With a specialty in the Ayam Panggang, the shop is known for using only fresh chicken.
After machine-dipping it into their signature black sauce, it’s served with steamed rice and topped with coconut curry. Most dishes, including squid and fish cooked with the same technique, cost around $6 on average. 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-44, S(238895)
 
13. Thai Tantric
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
Most people flock to Jane Thai at Orchard Towers, but its opening hours (evening only) are a real bummer. Thai Tantric’s opening hours (11am-3pm, 6pm-3am) are friendlier because no lust for Thai food should go unsatisfied. 
Popular dishes include Phad Thai ($6.50), Tom Yum Seafood Soup ($10) and Fried Glass Noodles with Seafood ($7), while most side dishes are priced below $10. Orchard Towers may not be the most pristine mall around, but great prices and authenticity rarely reside in upscale grounds and polished walls. 
Address: Orchard Towers, 400 Orchard Road, #03-23, S(238875)
 
14. Astons Specialities
 
Source
Damage: $6.90
Astons Specialties is a restaurant that requires no introduction, and one of the few I find worth queueing for. Apart from the steaks and chops, most pastas, burgers and fish dishes go for below $10. I love the flexibility in selecting sides, though I always find myself ending up with Mac & Cheese and Garden Vegetables. 
Address: #03-04 *SCAPE, 2 Orchard Link, S(237978)
 
15. Gyoza-Ya
 


Damage: $6.50
The Pan-fried Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had perfect skin - thin, crispy, and not too greasy. The chives and vegetable bits added texture to the sweet and soft pork filling. On the other hand, the Steamed Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had a soft and luscious exterior, served with their house special sauce. I personally preferred the former as I found the sauce to be a little too salty.  
This little-known place is ambient and surprisingly affordable. Sides are priced between $3.80-6.80, while mains cost $6.50-$6.80. It’s Robinsons’ well-kept secret!
Address: Robinsons Heeren, 260 Orchard Road, #B1-02A, S(238855)
 
16. River Valley Nasi Lemak 
 

Damage: $3.80
The cheapest of the lot is found at $3.80 at a remote corner of Lucky Plaza’s basement. I love the rice and chili best - foundation of any Nasi Lemak. The rice was some of the most fragrant I’ve tasted - each bite flavorful with coconut milk, perfect when paired with the sambal chili. The sides tasted average at best, but the variety is well worth the price. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #B1-99/101, S(238863)
 
17. Quiznos  
 

Damage: $6.90
As I unwrapped it my 6-inch Classic Italian Sub ($6.90), I judged it a little; it wasn’t the most good-looking sandwich. But the misunderstood sub soon redeemed itself.
The freshly toasted Rosemary Parmesan bread was so good it can be eaten on its own, appetizing with its aroma of herb and cheese combined. It would be perfect if the vegetables were fresher and crunchier, but the meats made up for it. Topped with mozzarella and red wine vinaigrette, the deli meats (pepperoni, salami, capicola and ham) were juicier and tastier than that of any other sub!
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #03-31, S(238896)
 
18. Jtown Cafe
 
SourceSource
Damage: Under $8
Jtown is an eatery located at the basement of Midpoint Orchard that serves Indonesian delicacies. Mains like the Bakmie Aya Bakso (pictured above) and the Black Pepper Bakso, which seems like the Indonesian version of Jajamen will cost you no more than $8, complete with a drink. There’s a variety of interesting Murtabak as well, with flavors like cheese, chocolate and even durian.
Address:#B1-04/05 Midpoint Orchard, 220 Orchard Road, S(238852)
 
19. Eighteen Chefs 
 
Source
Damage: $6.40
Back when I was in school, 18 Chefs was a regular hangout. Today, the menu has grown about 3 times more extensive, but the student meal still costs $6.40 - a price I remember to be constant throughout these years. Even if you’re not a student, the “Be Your Own Chef” option remains a highly popular and customizable classic for baked rice and pastas below $10.
Address: #04-02 Cineleisure Orchard, 8 Grange Road, S(239695)
 
20. Central Hong Kong Cafe
 
Source
Damage: Under $10.
Unlike most Hong Kong cafes, this shop makes you stop in your tracks to admire the furnishing. With patterned tiles and grilles, old school celebrity posters and a soundtrack made up of Cantonese oldies, it’s clear that a lot of thought went into the creating an ambience. As most of the popular street food such as egg noodles and specialty toasts are priced affordably, you can easily dine for less than $10.
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #02-30, S(238896)
 
21. Greenview Cafe
 

Damage: $4.50
In different shapes and sizes, the Mee Hoon Kueh Dry ($4.50) at Greenview Cafe is handmade, unlike the identical machine-cut squares sold at food courts. The thicker slices may not be for everyone, but I personally loved the Q-ness. The prawns (with an alternative of minced pork) were fresh and crisp while the sauce was the right amounts of sweet and salty, making this a favorite comfort food accessible in town.

Address: Robinsons Heeren, 260 Orchard Road, #B1-02A, S(238855)
 
16. River Valley Nasi Lemak 
 

Damage: $3.80
The cheapest of the lot is found at $3.80 at a remote corner of Lucky Plaza’s basement. I love the rice and chili best - foundation of any Nasi Lemak. The rice was some of the most fragrant I’ve tasted - each bite flavorful with coconut milk, perfect when paired with the sambal chili. The sides tasted average at best, but the variety is well worth the price. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #B1-99/101, S(238863)
 
17. Quiznos  
 

Damage: $6.90
As I unwrapped it my 6-inch Classic Italian Sub ($6.90), I judged it a little; it wasn’t the most good-looking sandwich. But the misunderstood sub soon redeemed itself.
The freshly toasted Rosemary Parmesan bread was so good it can be eaten on its own, appetizing with its aroma of herb and cheese combined. It would be perfect if the vegetables were fresher and crunchier, but the meats made up for it. Topped with mozzarella and red wine vinaigrette, the deli meats (pepperoni, salami, capicola and ham) were juicier and tastier than that of any other sub!
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #03-31, S(238896)
 
18. Jtown Cafe
 
SourceSource
Damage: Under $8
Jtown is an eatery located at the basement of Midpoint Orchard that serves Indonesian delicacies. Mains like the Bakmie Aya Bakso (pictured above) and the Black Pepper Bakso, which seems like the Indonesian version of Jajamen will cost you no more than $8, complete with a drink. There’s a variety of interesting Murtabak as well, with flavors like cheese, chocolate and even durian.
Address:#B1-04/05 Midpoint Orchard, 220 Orchard Road, S(238852)
 
19. Eighteen Chefs 
 
Source
Damage: $6.40
Back when I was in school, 18 Chefs was a regular hangout. Today, the menu has grown about 3 times more extensive, but the student meal still costs $6.40 - a price I remember to be constant throughout these years. Even if you’re not a student, the “Be Your Own Chef” option remains a highly popular and customizable classic for baked rice and pastas below $10.
Address: #04-02 Cineleisure Orchard, 8 Grange Road, S(239695)
 
20. Central Hong Kong Cafe
 
Source
Damage: Under $10.
Unlike most Hong Kong cafes, this shop makes you stop in your tracks to admire the furnishing. With patterned tiles and grilles, old school celebrity posters and a soundtrack made up of Cantonese oldies, it’s clear that a lot of thought went into the creating an ambience. As most of the popular street food such as egg noodles and specialty toasts are priced affordably, you can easily dine for less than $10.
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #02-30, S(238896)
 
21. Greenview Cafe
 

Damage: $4.50
In different shapes and sizes, the Mee Hoon Kueh Dry ($4.50) at Greenview Cafe is handmade, unlike the identical machine-cut squares sold at food courts. The thicker slices may not be for everyone, but I personally loved the Q-ness. The prawns (with an alternative of minced pork) were fresh and crisp while the sauce was the right amounts of sweet and salty, making this a favorite comfort food accessible in town. 
Address: Far East Plaza, 14 Scotts Road, #04-96, S(228213)
 
22. Gyoza no Ohsho
 
Source
Damage: $10
Ohsho is a Japanese casual dining joint located in Cuppage Plaza, within walking distance of Somerset MRT. In spite of its small size, the menu is quite extensive. Ramen here starts from $11, but for less than $10, you’d be able to get Yakiudon or Yakisoba, and a selection of rice dishes. For more value, look out for the set meals they offer!
Address: #01-10 Cuppage Plaza, 5 Koek Road, S(228796)
 
Bonus: Espuma Lab 
 
Source
Here’s something extra for those who’re willing to walk for cheap food. Which should mean everyone. 
Espuma Lab in PoMo features Michelin-style culinary methods like Espuma (foam) and Sous Vide (thermal circulator). Those are interesting techniques to pay attention to if you aren’t distracted by the prices yet.
Main courses are unbelievably priced at - get this - $6.80! Top-ups for a drink and a bowl of soup cost only $2. If you’re an all-day breakfast fanatic, this place also makes poached eggs with a side of Norwegian Salmon or Sauteed Mushrooms for less than $5!
Address: 1 Selegie Road, #01-20/21, PoMo,  S(188306)
 
Busting the Myth
 
There are many different ways people spend $10 in town these days. Some buy a Venti beverage because Starbucks’ Christmas Drinks can take all their money, while others join a froyo queue so long a security guard is stationed to manage it. 
If you can no longer enjoy the privilege of flashing your student card, it’s unlikely that $10 will get you much in today’s economy. We hope this article has helped you discover more choices in every nook and cranny of Orchard Road!
In fact, if you’re savvy enough, you may even have money left for dessert: Source

Cheap Food In Orchard Road 
 
Noble quests have always faced skepticism. 
Prior to my hunt for meals below $10 in Orchard Road, I surveyed my friends. Some looked at me as if I had just suggested we pool our savings to buy a unicorn. “Siao ah, this is Singapore babe”, they reminded me. One guy suggested McDonald’s. Oh, pure and utter audacity. 
Remember the days when Chicken Rice was $1? Me neither, but my parents would. Contrary to popular belief and common Singapore complaints, it’s possible to dine in Orchard Road without burning a hole in your pocket.
Here are 18 wallet-friendly meals you never knew about. 
 
1. Shi Li Fang Hotpot
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
At a price of $9.90++, choose from the Beef Tenderloin, Special Fish Head, Specialty Chicken/Pork Tenderloin, Pork Belly, Mushroom or Vegetables lunchtime (till 4pm) set meals. Each meal comes with a vegetables platter and a choice of handmade/egg noodles, rice or vermicelli. Also, every hotpot is personal so you reserve all rights to pick that soup base all your friends hate!
The total bill should come up to about $12 after tax, but what’s an extra few dollars when most hotpot restaurants in Orchard Road cost at least $30?
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #07-10/11, S(238896)
 
2. Tsuru-Koshi Udon
 

Damage: $10
From a selection of Udon and Donburi below $14, I ordered the Ebi Tempura Udon ($10). The soup was slightly salty without being overwhelming. The Udon was silky and smooth as promised when enjoyed with the Onsen Egg ($1). Though I would like my tempura to be crispier, this is the go-to place when you’re craving something hot and soupy. Many patrons are Japanese themselves!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B201-3, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
3. Hainanese Delicacy 
 

Damage: $4
I seriously suspect that I’m the only noob who has never tried this. I don’t care that it’s been reviewed to death! I need to gush about it once more to get it out of my system. 
Even though it was lunchtime, the line at Hainanese Delicacy moved quickly. I loved that the boneless meat of the Roasted Chicken Rice ($4) fully captured the sauce’s essence in its tender goodness, but it was the chilli that won me over. I don’t wanna jinx it, but this may be the best I’ve had.
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-116, S(228213)
 
4. Fisherios 
 

Damage: $7.90
Fisherios at Takashimaya Food Basement is hard to miss - with its inviting display of oysters and the smell of freshly fried fish. With a specialty in the Beer Battered Fish & Chips ($7.90), other house specials include Breaded fish ($8.90), Snapper ($9.90), Salmon ($9.90), and Shrimp ($8.90). This puts an end to paying $20 for a plate of fish & chips!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-4-2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
5. Dong Dae Mun
 

Damage: Sticks of meat from $1
Dong Dae Mun at Somerset 313 is the only outlet islandwide that serves meals like Kimchi Fried Rice and Korean Ramyun, within a dining space that fits about 12 people. 
The tantalising sight of sauce sizzling on the hot plate didn’t disappoint. Even though the chicken slices were thin, the portion was fairly large and well worth the money.
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-49, S(238895)
 
6. Kim Dae Mun
 
Source
Damage: Under $8
Further down the road is another Korean food spot to check out on the second floor of Concorde Hotel. There’s often a long queue in spite of its remote location, and it isn’t difficult to see why. Set meals and side dishes are priced below $8, and patrons have raved about the prices and authenticity.
Also, rumor has it that the hotplate items are cooked with water instead of oil!
Address: #02-17/18 Concorde Hotel Singapore, 100 Orchard Road, S(238840)
 
7. Ayam Penyet Ria
 

Damage: $7.90
The Ayam Penyet ($7.90) was a mouth-watering sight - crumbs everywhere! Throughout the whole meal, I was that ridiculous emoji with heart shapes for eyes.  
The chefs mastered the art of deep-frying chicken - the skin was crispy but the thigh meat was still moist. It’s sinful but worth every calorie. You must order a drink because the chili was so intense, my tongue burned all the way from Lucky Plaza to Far East Plaza. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #04-25, S(238863)
 
8. Pies & Coffee
 
Source
Damage: $6
If you love a pie but hate the mess of having it to-go, dine in at Pies & Coffee! With a menu that carries both sweet and savory pies priced between $6-12, it’s an ideal spot for a meal or snack. Savory pies are served with a side of mashed potatoes and salad greens. 
Address: The Centrepoint, 176 Orchard Road, #01-101-104, S(238843)  
 
9. Yonehachi 
 

Damage: $7.80
Meet Okowa rice, cousin of Lo Mai Kai,  only less greasy and of a Japanese descent. Each mouthful of the Salmon Okowa Rice Set ($7.80) was wholesome and tasty, best enjoyed with the side of pickles. This set comes in 4 other flavors and suit small to moderate eaters best. Go for the larger set meals with Unagi or Chicken Teriyaki if you’d like something more substantial. 
Tip: If you don’t have time to dine in, takeaway options are available too! 
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-1/2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
10. New Station Snack Bar
 

Damage: $6
This zi char shop is usually crowded and cramped, but discomfort is a small price to pay for my Salted Egg Pork Ribs Rice ($6). The pork ribs are soft and the salted egg sauce was easily the highlight of the dish. The curry leaves and chili padi gave it a tinge of spiciness, so it was creamy without being overly jelat. 
Tip: This dish is only on the Chinese menu so if you can’t read those characters to save your life, it’s No. 6. You’re welcome. 
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-95, S(228213)
 
11. Smoothie King 
 
Source
Damage: $6-7
On days when I’m feeling healthy, I try to avoid eye contact with the bubble tea shop and go to Smoothie King instead, where my first smoothie won half my heart just by being pastel-colored. 
A smoothie easily cost about $6-7, but the $9.90 set meal gets you an additional wrap or salad. It’s a triumph to score a meal in Orchard for $10, but to have it for under 500 calories is pure win! 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #01-14/15, S(238895)
 
12. Riverside Indonesian BBQ
 
Source
Damage: $6
Fans of the famous Indonesian BBQ Store in Plaza Singapura Kopitiam will be excited to know that 313 Somerset and Ion Orchard are homes to 2 other branches. With a specialty in the Ayam Panggang, the shop is known for using only fresh chicken.
After machine-dipping it into their signature black sauce, it’s served with steamed rice and topped with coconut curry. Most dishes, including squid and fish cooked with the same technique, cost around $6 on average. 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-44, S(238895)
 
13. Thai Tantric
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
Most people flock to Jane Thai at Orchard Towers, but its opening hours (evening only) are a real bummer. Thai Tantric’s opening hours (11am-3pm, 6pm-3am) are friendlier because no lust for Thai food should go unsatisfied. 
Popular dishes include Phad Thai ($6.50), Tom Yum Seafood Soup ($10) and Fried Glass Noodles with Seafood ($7), while most side dishes are priced below $10. Orchard Towers may not be the most pristine mall around, but great prices and authenticity rarely reside in upscale grounds and polished walls. 
Address: Orchard Towers, 400 Orchard Road, #03-23, S(238875)
 
14. Astons Specialities
 
Source
Damage: $6.90
Astons Specialties is a restaurant that requires no introduction, and one of the few I find worth queueing for. Apart from the steaks and chops, most pastas, burgers and fish dishes go for below $10. I love the flexibility in selecting sides, though I always find myself ending up with Mac & Cheese and Garden Vegetables. 
Address: #03-04 *SCAPE, 2 Orchard Link, S(237978)
 
15. Gyoza-Ya
 


Damage: $6.50
The Pan-fried Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had perfect skin - thin, crispy, and not too greasy. The chives and vegetable bits added texture to the sweet and soft pork filling. On the other hand, the Steamed Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had a soft and luscious exterior, served with their house special sauce. I personally preferred the former as I found the sauce to be a little too salty.  
This little-known place is ambient and surprisingly affordable. Sides are priced between $3.80-6.80, while mains cost $6.50-$6.80. It’s Robinsons’ well-kept secret!
Address: Robinsons Heeren, 260 Orchard Road, #B1-02A, S(238855)
 
16. River Valley Nasi Lemak 
 

Damage: $3.80
The cheapest of the lot is found at $3.80 at a remote corner of Lucky Plaza’s basement. I love the rice and chili best - foundation of any Nasi Lemak. The rice was some of the most fragrant I’ve tasted - each bite flavorful with coconut milk, perfect when paired with the sambal chili. The sides tasted average at best, but the variety is well worth the price. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #B1-99/101, S(238863)
 
17. Quiznos  
 

Damage: $6.90
As I unwrapped it my 6-inch Classic Italian Sub ($6.90), I judged it a little; it wasn’t the most good-looking sandwich. But the misunderstood sub soon redeemed itself.
The freshly toasted Rosemary Parmesan bread was so good it can be eaten on its own, appetizing with its aroma of herb and cheese combined. It would be perfect if the vegetables were fresher and crunchier, but the meats made up for it. Topped with mozzarella and red wine vinaigrette, the deli meats (pepperoni, salami, capicola and ham) were juicier and tastier than that of any other sub!
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #03-31, S(238896)

Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #02-30, S(238896)
 
21. Greenview Cafe
 

Damage: $4.50
In different shapes and sizes, the Mee Hoon Kueh Dry ($4.50) at Greenview Cafe is handmade, unlike the identical machine-cut squares sold at food courts. The thicker slices may not be for everyone, but I personally loved the Q-ness. The prawns (with an alternative of minced pork) were fresh and crisp while the sauce was the right amounts of sweet and salty, making this a favorite comfort food accessible in town. 
Address: Far East Plaza, 14 Scotts Road, #04-96, S(228213)
 
22. Gyoza no Ohsho

Ohsho is a Japanese casual dining joint located in Cuppage Plaza, within walking distance of Somerset MRT. In spite of its small size, the menu is quite extensive. Ramen here starts from $11, but for less than $10, you’d be able to get Yakiudon or Yakisoba, and a selection of rice dishes. For more value, look out for the set meals they offer!

Bonus: Espuma Lab

Here’s something extra for those who’re willing to walk for cheap food. Which should mean everyone. 
Espuma Lab in PoMo features Michelin-style culinary methods like Espuma (foam) and Sous Vide (thermal circulator). Those are interesting techniques to pay attention to if you aren’t distracted by the prices yet.

Source
Damage: $9.90
Most people flock to Jane Thai at Orchard Towers, but its opening hours (evening only) are a real bummer. Thai Tantric’s opening hours (11am-3pm, 6pm-3am) are friendlier because no lust for Thai food should go unsatisfied. 
Popular dishes include Phad Thai ($6.50), Tom Yum Seafood Soup ($10) and Fried Glass Noodles with Seafood ($7), while most side dishes are priced below $10. Orchard Towers may not be the most pristine mall around, but great prices and authenticity rarely reside in upscale grounds and polished walls. 
Address: Orchard Towers, 400 Orchard Road, #03-23, S(238875)
 
14. Astons Specialities
 
Source
Damage: $6.90
Astons Specialties is a restaurant that requires no introduction, and one of the few I find worth queueing for. Apart from the steaks and chops, most pastas, burgers and fish dishes go for below $10. I love the flexibility in selecting sides, though I always find myself ending up with Mac & Cheese and Garden Vegetables. 
Address: #03-04 *SCAPE, 2 Orchard Link, S(237978)
 
15. Gyoza-Ya
 


Damage: $6.50
The Pan-fried Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had perfect skin - thin, crispy, and not too greasy. The chives and vegetable bits added texture to the sweet and soft pork filling. On the other hand, the Steamed Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had a soft and luscious exterior, served with their house special sauce. I personally preferred the former as I found the sauce to be a little too salty.  
This little-known place is ambient and surprisingly affordable. Sides are priced between $3.80-6.80, while mains cost $6.50-$6.80. It’s Robinsons’ well-kept secret!
Address: Robinsons Heeren, 260 Orchard Road, #B1-02A, S(238855)
 
16. River Valley Nasi Lemak 
 

Damage: $3.80
The cheapest of the lot is found at $3.80 at a remote corner of Lucky Plaza’s basement. I love the rice and chili best - foundation of any Nasi Lemak. The rice was some of the most fragrant I’ve tasted - each bite flavorful with coconut milk, perfect when paired with the sambal chili. The sides tasted average at best, but the variety is well worth the price. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #B1-99/101, S(238863)
 
17. Quiznos  
 

Damage: $6.90
As I unwrapped it my 6-inch Classic Italian Sub ($6.90), I judged it a little; it wasn’t the most good-looking sandwich. But the misunderstood sub soon redeemed itself.
The freshly toasted Rosemary Parmesan bread was so good it can be eaten on its own, appetizing with its aroma of herb and cheese combined. It would be perfect if the vegetables were fresher and crunchier, but the meats made up for it. Topped with mozzarella and red wine vinaigrette, the deli meats (pepperoni, salami, capicola and ham) were juicier and tastier than that of any other sub!
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #03-31, S(238896)
 
18. Jtown Cafe
 
SourceSource
Damage: Under $8
Jtown is an eatery located at the basement of Midpoint Orchard that serves Indonesian delicacies. Mains like the Bakmie Aya Bakso (pictured above) and the Black Pepper Bakso, which seems like the Indonesian version of Jajamen will cost you no more than $8, complete with a drink. There’s a variety of interesting Murtabak as well, with flavors like cheese, chocolate and even durian.
Address:#B1-04/05 Midpoint Orchard, 220 Orchard Road, S(238852)
 
19. Eighteen Chefs 
 
Source
Damage: $6.40
Back when I was in school, 18 Chefs was a regular hangout. Today, the menu has grown about 3 times more extensive, but the student meal still costs $6.40 - a price I remember to be constant throughout these years. Even if you’re not a student, the “Be Your Own Chef” option remains a highly popular and customizable classic for baked rice and pastas below $10.
Address: #04-02 Cineleisure Orchard, 8 Grange Road, S(239695)
 
20. Central Hong Kong Cafe
 
Source
Damage: Under $10.
Unlike most Hong Kong cafes, this shop makes you stop in your tracks to admire the furnishing. With patterned tiles and grilles, old school celebrity posters and a soundtrack made up of Cantonese oldies, it’s clear that a lot of thought went into the creating an ambience. As most of the popular street food such as egg noodles and specialty toasts are priced affordably, you can easily dine for less than $10.
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #02-30, S(238896)
 
21. Greenview Cafe
 

Damage: $4.50
In different shapes and sizes, the Mee Hoon Kueh Dry ($4.50) at Greenview Cafe is handmade, unlike the identical machine-cut squares sold at food courts. The thicker slices may not be for everyone, but I personally loved the Q-ness. The prawns (with an alternative of minced pork) were fresh and crisp while the sauce was the right amounts of sweet and salty, making this a favorite comfort food accessible in town. 
Address: Far East Plaza, 14 Scotts Road, #04-96, S(228213)
 
22. Gyoza no Ohsho
 
Source
Damage: $10
Ohsho is a Japanese casual dining joint located in Cuppage Plaza, within walking distance of Somerset MRT. In spite of its small size, the menu is quite extensive. Ramen here starts from $11, but for less than $10, you’d be able to get Yakiudon or Yakisoba, and a selection of rice dishes. For more value, look out for the set meals they offer!
Address: #01-10 Cuppage Plaza, 5 Koek Road, S(228796)
 
Bonus: Espuma Lab 
 
Source
Here’s something extra for those who’re willing to walk for cheap food. Which should mean everyone. 
Espuma Lab in PoMo features Michelin-style culinary methods like Espuma (foam) and Sous Vide (thermal circulator). Those are interesting techniques to pay attention to if you aren’t distracted by the prices yet.
Main courses are unbelievably priced at - get this - $6.80! Top-ups for a drink and a bowl of soup cost only $2. If you’re an all-day breakfast fanatic, this place also makes poached eggs with a side of Norwegian Salmon or Sauteed Mushrooms for less than $5!
Address: 1 Selegie Road, #01-20/21, PoMo,  S(188306)
 
Busting the Myth
 
There are many different ways people spend $10 in town these days. Some buy a Venti beverage because Starbucks’ Christmas Drinks can take all their money, while others join a froyo queue so long a security guard is stationed to manage it. 
If you can no longer enjoy the privilege of flashing your student card, it’s unlikely that $10 will get you much in today’s economy. We hope this article has helped you discover more choices in every nook and cranny of Orchard Road!
In fact, if you’re savvy enough, you may even have money left for dessert: Source

Cheap Food In Orchard Road 
 
Noble quests have always faced skepticism. 
Prior to my hunt for meals below $10 in Orchard Road, I surveyed my friends. Some looked at me as if I had just suggested we pool our savings to buy a unicorn. “Siao ah, this is Singapore babe”, they reminded me. One guy suggested McDonald’s. Oh, pure and utter audacity. 
Remember the days when Chicken Rice was $1? Me neither, but my parents would. Contrary to popular belief and common Singapore complaints, it’s possible to dine in Orchard Road without burning a hole in your pocket.
Here are 18 wallet-friendly meals you never knew about. 
 
1. Shi Li Fang Hotpot
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
At a price of $9.90++, choose from the Beef Tenderloin, Special Fish Head, Specialty Chicken/Pork Tenderloin, Pork Belly, Mushroom or Vegetables lunchtime (till 4pm) set meals. Each meal comes with a vegetables platter and a choice of handmade/egg noodles, rice or vermicelli. Also, every hotpot is personal so you reserve all rights to pick that soup base all your friends hate!
The total bill should come up to about $12 after tax, but what’s an extra few dollars when most hotpot restaurants in Orchard Road cost at least $30?
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #07-10/11, S(238896)
 
2. Tsuru-Koshi Udon
 

Damage: $10
From a selection of Udon and Donburi below $14, I ordered the Ebi Tempura Udon ($10). The soup was slightly salty without being overwhelming. The Udon was silky and smooth as promised when enjoyed with the Onsen Egg ($1). Though I would like my tempura to be crispier, this is the go-to place when you’re craving something hot and soupy. Many patrons are Japanese themselves!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B201-3, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
3. Hainanese Delicacy 
 

Damage: $4
I seriously suspect that I’m the only noob who has never tried this. I don’t care that it’s been reviewed to death! I need to gush about it once more to get it out of my system. 
Even though it was lunchtime, the line at Hainanese Delicacy moved quickly. I loved that the boneless meat of the Roasted Chicken Rice ($4) fully captured the sauce’s essence in its tender goodness, but it was the chilli that won me over. I don’t wanna jinx it, but this may be the best I’ve had.
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-116, S(228213)
 
4. Fisherios 
 

Damage: $7.90
Fisherios at Takashimaya Food Basement is hard to miss - with its inviting display of oysters and the smell of freshly fried fish. With a specialty in the Beer Battered Fish & Chips ($7.90), other house specials include Breaded fish ($8.90), Snapper ($9.90), Salmon ($9.90), and Shrimp ($8.90). This puts an end to paying $20 for a plate of fish & chips!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-4-2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
5. Dong Dae Mun
 

Damage: Sticks of meat from $1
Dong Dae Mun at Somerset 313 is the only outlet islandwide that serves meals like Kimchi Fried Rice and Korean Ramyun, within a dining space that fits about 12 people. 
The tantalising sight of sauce sizzling on the hot plate didn’t disappoint. Even though the chicken slices were thin, the portion was fairly large and well worth the money.
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-49, S(238895)
 
6. Kim Dae Mun
 
Source
Damage: Under $8
Further down the road is another Korean food spot to check out on the second floor of Concorde Hotel. There’s often a long queue in spite of its remote location, and it isn’t difficult to see why. Set meals and side dishes are priced below $8, and patrons have raved about the prices and authenticity.
Also, rumor has it that the hotplate items are cooked with water instead of oil!
Address: #02-17/18 Concorde Hotel Singapore, 100 Orchard Road, S(238840)
 
7. Ayam Penyet Ria
 

Damage: $7.90
The Ayam Penyet ($7.90) was a mouth-watering sight - crumbs everywhere! Throughout the whole meal, I was that ridiculous emoji with heart shapes for eyes.  
The chefs mastered the art of deep-frying chicken - the skin was crispy but the thigh meat was still moist. It’s sinful but worth every calorie. You must order a drink because the chili was so intense, my tongue burned all the way from Lucky Plaza to Far East Plaza. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #04-25, S(238863)
 
8. Pies & Coffee
 
Source
Damage: $6
If you love a pie but hate the mess of having it to-go, dine in at Pies & Coffee! With a menu that carries both sweet and savory pies priced between $6-12, it’s an ideal spot for a meal or snack. Savory pies are served with a side of mashed potatoes and salad greens. 
Address: The Centrepoint, 176 Orchard Road, #01-101-104, S(238843)  
 
9. Yonehachi 
 

Damage: $7.80
Meet Okowa rice, cousin of Lo Mai Kai,  only less greasy and of a Japanese descent. Each mouthful of the Salmon Okowa Rice Set ($7.80) was wholesome and tasty, best enjoyed with the side of pickles. This set comes in 4 other flavors and suit small to moderate eaters best. Go for the larger set meals with Unagi or Chicken Teriyaki if you’d like something more substantial. 
Tip: If you don’t have time to dine in, takeaway options are available too! 
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-1/2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
10. New Station Snack Bar
 

Damage: $6
This zi char shop is usually crowded and cramped, but discomfort is a small price to pay for my Salted Egg Pork Ribs Rice ($6). The pork ribs are soft and the salted egg sauce was easily the highlight of the dish. The curry leaves and chili padi gave it a tinge of spiciness, so it was creamy without being overly jelat. 
Tip: This dish is only on the Chinese menu so if you can’t read those characters to save your life, it’s No. 6. You’re welcome. 
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-95, S(228213)
 
11. Smoothie King 
 
Source
Damage: $6-7
On days when I’m feeling healthy, I try to avoid eye contact with the bubble tea shop and go to Smoothie King instead, where my first smoothie won half my heart just by being pastel-colored. 
A smoothie easily cost about $6-7, but the $9.90 set meal gets you an additional wrap or salad. It’s a triumph to score a meal in Orchard for $10, but to have it for under 500 calories is pure win! 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #01-14/15, S(238895)
 
12. Riverside Indonesian BBQ
 
Source
Damage: $6
Fans of the famous Indonesian BBQ Store in Plaza Singapura Kopitiam will be excited to know that 313 Somerset and Ion Orchard are homes to 2 other branches. With a specialty in the Ayam Panggang, the shop is known for using only fresh chicken.
After machine-dipping it into their signature black sauce, it’s served with steamed rice and topped with coconut curry. Most dishes, including squid and fish cooked with the same technique, cost around $6 on average. 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-44, S(238895)
 
13. Thai Tantric

Damage: $9.90
Most people flock to Jane Thai at Orchard Towers, but its opening hours (evening only) are a real bummer. Thai Tantric’s opening hours (11am-3pm, 6pm-3am) are friendlier because no lust for Thai food should go unsatisfied. 
Popular dishes include Phad Thai ($6.50), Tom Yum Seafood Soup ($10) and Fried Glass Noodles with Seafood ($7), while most side dishes are priced below $10. Orchard Towers may not be the most pristine mall around, but great prices and authenticity rarely reside in upscale grounds and polished walls. 
Address: Orchard Towers, 400 Orchard Road, #03-23, S(238875)
 
14. Astons Specialities

Damage: $6.90
Astons Specialties is a restaurant that requires no introduction, and one of the few I find worth queueing for. Apart from the steaks and chops, most pastas, burgers and fish dishes go for below $10. I love the flexibility in selecting sides, though I always find myself ending up with Mac & Cheese and Garden Vegetables. 
Address: #03-04 *SCAPE, 2 Orchard Link, S(237978)
 
15. Gyoza-Ya
 


Damage: $6.50

On the other hand, the Steamed Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had a soft and luscious exterior, served with their house special sauce.

Address: Robinsons Heeren, 260 Orchard Road, #B1-02A, S(238855)
 
16. River Valley Nasi Lemak 
 

Damage: $3.80
The cheapest of the lot is found at $3.80 at a remote corner of Lucky Plaza’s basement. I love the rice and chili best - foundation of any Nasi Lemak. The rice was some of the most fragrant I’ve tasted - each bite flavorful with coconut milk, perfect when paired with the sambal chili. The sides tasted average at best, but the variety is well worth the price. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #B1-99/101, S(238863)
 
17. Quiznos  
 

Damage: $6.90
As I unwrapped it my 6-inch Classic Italian Sub ($6.90), I judged it a little; it wasn’t the most good-looking sandwich. But the misunderstood sub soon redeemed itself.
The freshly toasted Rosemary Parmesan bread was so good it can be eaten on its own, appetizing with its aroma of herb and cheese combined. It would be perfect if the vegetables were fresher and crunchier, but the meats made up for it. Topped with mozzarella and red wine vinaigrette, the deli meats (pepperoni, salami, capicola and ham) were juicier and tastier than that of any other sub!

The pork ribs are soft and the salted egg sauce was easily the highlight of the dish. The curry leaves and chili padi gave it a tinge of spiciness, so it was creamy without being overly jelat. 
Tip: This dish is only on the Chinese menu so if you can’t read those characters to save your life, it’s No. 6. You’re welcome. 
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-95, S(228213)
 
11. Smoothie King 
 
Source
Damage: $6-7
On days when I’m feeling healthy, I try to avoid eye contact with the bubble tea shop and go to Smoothie King instead, where my first smoothie won half my heart just by being pastel-colored. 
A smoothie easily cost about $6-7, but the $9.90 set meal gets you an additional wrap or salad. It’s a triumph to score a meal in Orchard for $10, but to have it for under 500 calories is pure win! 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #01-14/15, S(238895)
 
12. Riverside Indonesian BBQ
 
Source
Damage: $6
Fans of the famous Indonesian BBQ Store in Plaza Singapura Kopitiam will be excited to know that 313 Somerset and Ion Orchard are homes to 2 other branches. With a specialty in the Ayam Panggang, the shop is known for using only fresh chicken.
After machine-dipping it into their signature black sauce, it’s served with steamed rice and topped with coconut curry. Most dishes, including squid and fish cooked with the same technique, cost around $6 on average. 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-44, S(238895)
 
13. Thai Tantric
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
Most people flock to Jane Thai at Orchard Towers, but its opening hours (evening only) are a real bummer. Thai Tantric’s opening hours (11am-3pm, 6pm-3am) are friendlier because no lust for Thai food should go unsatisfied. 
Popular dishes include Phad Thai ($6.50), Tom Yum Seafood Soup ($10) and Fried Glass Noodles with Seafood ($7), while most side dishes are priced below $10. Orchard Towers may not be the most pristine mall around, but great prices and authenticity rarely reside in upscale grounds and polished walls. 
Address: Orchard Towers, 400 Orchard Road, #03-23, S(238875)
 
14. Astons Specialities
 
Source
Damage: $6.90
Astons Specialties is a restaurant that requires no introduction, and one of the few I find worth queueing for. Apart from the steaks and chops, most pastas, burgers and fish dishes go for below $10. I love the flexibility in selecting sides, though I always find myself ending up with Mac & Cheese and Garden Vegetables. 
Address: #03-04 *SCAPE, 2 Orchard Link, S(237978)
 
15. Gyoza-Ya
 


Damage: $6.50
The Pan-fried Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had perfect skin - thin, crispy, and not too greasy. The chives and vegetable bits added texture to the sweet and soft pork filling. On the other hand, the Steamed Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had a soft and luscious exterior, served with their house special sauce. I personally preferred the former as I found the sauce to be a little too salty.  
This little-known place is ambient and surprisingly affordable. Sides are priced between $3.80-6.80, while mains cost $6.50-$6.80. It’s Robinsons’ well-kept secret!
Address: Robinsons Heeren, 260 Orchard Road, #B1-02A, S(238855)
 
16. River Valley Nasi Lemak 
 

Damage: $3.80
The cheapest of the lot is found at $3.80 at a remote corner of Lucky Plaza’s basement. I love the rice and chili best - foundation of any Nasi Lemak. The rice was some of the most fragrant I’ve tasted - each bite flavorful with coconut milk, perfect when paired with the sambal chili. The sides tasted average at best, but the variety is well worth the price. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #B1-99/101, S(238863)
 
17. Quiznos  
 

Damage: $6.90
As I unwrapped it my 6-inch Classic Italian Sub ($6.90), I judged it a little; it wasn’t the most good-looking sandwich. But the misunderstood sub soon redeemed itself.
The freshly toasted Rosemary Parmesan bread was so good it can be eaten on its own, appetizing with its aroma of herb and cheese combined. It would be perfect if the vegetables were fresher and crunchier, but the meats made up for it. Topped with mozzarella and red wine vinaigrette, the deli meats (pepperoni, salami, capicola and ham) were juicier and tastier than that of any other sub!
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #03-31, S(238896)
 
18. Jtown Cafe
 
SourceSource
Damage: Under $8
Jtown is an eatery located at the basement of Midpoint Orchard that serves Indonesian delicacies. Mains like the Bakmie Aya Bakso (pictured above) and the Black Pepper Bakso, which seems like the Indonesian version of Jajamen will cost you no more than $8, complete with a drink. There’s a variety of interesting Murtabak as well, with flavors like cheese, chocolate and even durian.
Address:#B1-04/05 Midpoint Orchard, 220 Orchard Road, S(238852)
 
19. Eighteen Chefs 
 
Source
Damage: $6.40
Back when I was in school, 18 Chefs was a regular hangout. Today, the menu has grown about 3 times more extensive, but the student meal still costs $6.40 - a price I remember to be constant throughout these years. Even if you’re not a student, the “Be Your Own Chef” option remains a highly popular and customizable classic for baked rice and pastas below $10.
Address: #04-02 Cineleisure Orchard, 8 Grange Road, S(239695)
 
20. Central Hong Kong Cafe
 
Source
Damage: Under $10.
Unlike most Hong Kong cafes, this shop makes you stop in your tracks to admire the furnishing. With patterned tiles and grilles, old school celebrity posters and a soundtrack made up of Cantonese oldies, it’s clear that a lot of thought went into the creating an ambience. As most of the popular street food such as egg noodles and specialty toasts are priced affordably, you can easily dine for less than $10.
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #02-30, S(238896)
 
21. Greenview Cafe
 

Damage: $4.50
In different shapes and sizes, the Mee Hoon Kueh Dry ($4.50) at Greenview Cafe is handmade, unlike the identical machine-cut squares sold at food courts. The thicker slices may not be for everyone, but I personally loved the Q-ness. The prawns (with an alternative of minced pork) were fresh and crisp while the sauce was the right amounts of sweet and salty, making this a favorite comfort food accessible in town. 
Address: Far East Plaza, 14 Scotts Road, #04-96, S(228213)
 
22. Gyoza no Ohsho
 
Source
Damage: $10
Ohsho is a Japanese casual dining joint located in Cuppage Plaza, within walking distance of Somerset MRT. In spite of its small size, the menu is quite extensive. Ramen here starts from $11, but for less than $10, you’d be able to get Yakiudon or Yakisoba, and a selection of rice dishes. For more value, look out for the set meals they offer!
Address: #01-10 Cuppage Plaza, 5 Koek Road, S(228796)
 
Bonus: Espuma Lab 
 
Source
Here’s something extra for those who’re willing to walk for cheap food. Which should mean everyone. 
Espuma Lab in PoMo features Michelin-style culinary methods like Espuma (foam) and Sous Vide (thermal circulator). Those are interesting techniques to pay attention to if you aren’t distracted by the prices yet.
Main courses are unbelievably priced at - get this - $6.80! Top-ups for a drink and a bowl of soup cost only $2. If you’re an all-day breakfast fanatic, this place also makes poached eggs with a side of Norwegian Salmon or Sauteed Mushrooms for less than $5!
Address: 1 Selegie Road, #01-20/21, PoMo,  S(188306)
 
Busting the Myth
 
There are many different ways people spend $10 in town these days. Some buy a Venti beverage because Starbucks’ Christmas Drinks can take all their money, while others join a froyo queue so long a security guard is stationed to manage it. 
If you can no longer enjoy the privilege of flashing your student card, it’s unlikely that $10 will get you much in today’s economy. We hope this article has helped you discover more choices in every nook and cranny of Orchard Road!
In fact, if you’re savvy enough, you may even have money left for dessert: Source

Cheap Food In Orchard Road 
 
Noble quests have always faced skepticism. 
Prior to my hunt for meals below $10 in Orchard Road, I surveyed my friends. Some looked at me as if I had just suggested we pool our savings to buy a unicorn. “Siao ah, this is Singapore babe”, they reminded me. One guy suggested McDonald’s. Oh, pure and utter audacity. 
Remember the days when Chicken Rice was $1? Me neither, but my parents would. Contrary to popular belief and common Singapore complaints, it’s possible to dine in Orchard Road without burning a hole in your pocket.
Here are 18 wallet-friendly meals you never knew about. 
 
1. Shi Li Fang Hotpot
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
At a price of $9.90++, choose from the Beef Tenderloin, Special Fish Head, Specialty Chicken/Pork Tenderloin, Pork Belly, Mushroom or Vegetables lunchtime (till 4pm) set meals. Each meal comes with a vegetables platter and a choice of handmade/egg noodles, rice or vermicelli. Also, every hotpot is personal so you reserve all rights to pick that soup base all your friends hate!
The total bill should come up to about $12 after tax, but what’s an extra few dollars when most hotpot restaurants in Orchard Road cost at least $30?
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #07-10/11, S(238896)
 
2. Tsuru-Koshi Udon
 

Damage: $10
From a selection of Udon and Donburi below $14, I ordered the Ebi Tempura Udon ($10). The soup was slightly salty without being overwhelming. The Udon was silky and smooth as promised when enjoyed with the Onsen Egg ($1). Though I would like my tempura to be crispier, this is the go-to place when you’re craving something hot and soupy. Many patrons are Japanese themselves!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B201-3, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
3. Hainanese Delicacy 
 

Damage: $4
I seriously suspect that I’m the only noob who has never tried this. I don’t care that it’s been reviewed to death! I need to gush about it once more to get it out of my system. 
Even though it was lunchtime, the line at Hainanese Delicacy moved quickly. I loved that the boneless meat of the Roasted Chicken Rice ($4) fully captured the sauce’s essence in its tender goodness, but it was the chilli that won me over. I don’t wanna jinx it, but this may be the best I’ve had.
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-116, S(228213)
 
4. Fisherios 
 

Damage: $7.90
Fisherios at Takashimaya Food Basement is hard to miss - with its inviting display of oysters and the smell of freshly fried fish. With a specialty in the Beer Battered Fish & Chips ($7.90), other house specials include Breaded fish ($8.90), Snapper ($9.90), Salmon ($9.90), and Shrimp ($8.90). This puts an end to paying $20 for a plate of fish & chips!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-4-2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
5. Dong Dae Mun
 

Damage: Sticks of meat from $1
Dong Dae Mun at Somerset 313 is the only outlet islandwide that serves meals like Kimchi Fried Rice and Korean Ramyun, within a dining space that fits about 12 people. 
The tantalising sight of sauce sizzling on the hot plate didn’t disappoint. Even though the chicken slices were thin, the portion was fairly large and well worth the money.
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-49, S(238895)
 
6. Kim Dae Mun
 
Source
Damage: Under $8
Further down the road is another Korean food spot to check out on the second floor of Concorde Hotel. There’s often a long queue in spite of its remote location, and it isn’t difficult to see why. Set meals and side dishes are priced below $8, and patrons have raved about the prices and authenticity.
Also, rumor has it that the hotplate items are cooked with water instead of oil!
Address: #02-17/18 Concorde Hotel Singapore, 100 Orchard Road, S(238840)
 
7. Ayam Penyet Ria
 

Damage: $7.90
The Ayam Penyet ($7.90) was a mouth-watering sight - crumbs everywhere! Throughout the whole meal, I was that ridiculous emoji with heart shapes for eyes.  
The chefs mastered the art of deep-frying chicken - the skin was crispy but the thigh meat was still moist. It’s sinful but worth every calorie. You must order a drink because the chili was so intense, my tongue burned all the way from Lucky Plaza to Far East Plaza. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #04-25, S(238863)
 
8. Pies & Coffee
 
Source
Damage: $6
If you love a pie but hate the mess of having it to-go, dine in at Pies & Coffee! With a menu that carries both sweet and savory pies priced between $6-12, it’s an ideal spot for a meal or snack. Savory pies are served with a side of mashed potatoes and salad greens. 
Address: The Centrepoint, 176 Orchard Road, #01-101-104, S(238843)  
 
9. Yonehachi 
 

Damage: $7.80
Meet Okowa rice, cousin of Lo Mai Kai,  only less greasy and of a Japanese descent. Each mouthful of the Salmon Okowa Rice Set ($7.80) was wholesome and tasty, best enjoyed with the side of pickles. This set comes in 4 other flavors and suit small to moderate eaters best. Go for the larger set meals with Unagi or Chicken Teriyaki if you’d like something more substantial. 
Tip: If you don’t have time to dine in, takeaway options are available too! 
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-1/2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
10. New Station Snack Bar
 

Damage: $6
This zi char shop is usually crowded and cramped, but discomfort is a small price to pay for my Salted Egg Pork Ribs Rice ($6). The pork ribs are soft and the salted egg sauce was easily the highlight of the dish. The curry leaves and chili padi gave it a tinge of spiciness, so it was creamy without being overly jelat. 
Tip: This dish is only on the Chinese menu so if you can’t read those characters to save your life, it’s No. 6. You’re welcome. 
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-95, S(228213)

Source
Damage: $6-7
On days when I’m feeling healthy, I try to avoid eye contact with the bubble tea shop and go to Smoothie King instead, where my first smoothie won half my heart just by being pastel-colored. 
A smoothie easily cost about $6-7, but the $9.90 set meal gets you an additional wrap or salad. It’s a triumph to score a meal in Orchard for $10, but to have it for under 500 calories is pure win!

Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-4-2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
5. Dong Dae Mun
 

Damage: Sticks of meat from $1
Dong Dae Mun at Somerset 313 is the only outlet islandwide that serves meals like Kimchi Fried Rice and Korean Ramyun, within a dining space that fits about 12 people. 
The tantalising sight of sauce sizzling on the hot plate didn’t disappoint. Even though the chicken slices were thin, the portion was fairly large and well worth the money.
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-49, S(238895)
 
6. Kim Dae Mun

Damage: Under $8
Further down the road is another Korean food spot to check out on the second floor of Concorde Hotel. There’s often a long queue in spite of its remote location, and it isn’t difficult to see why. Set meals and side dishes are priced below $8, and patrons have raved about the prices and authenticity.
Also, rumor has it that the hotplate items are cooked with water instead of oil!
Address: #02-17/18 Concorde Hotel Singapore, 100 Orchard Road, S(238840)
 
7. Ayam Penyet Ria
 

Damage: $7.90
The Ayam Penyet ($7.90) was a mouth-watering sight - crumbs everywhere! Throughout the whole meal, I was that ridiculous emoji with heart shapes for eyes.  
The chefs mastered the art of deep-frying chicken - the skin was crispy but the thigh meat was still moist. It’s sinful but worth every calorie. You must order a drink because the chili was so intense, my tongue burned all the way from Lucky Plaza to Far East Plaza. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #04-25, S(238863)
 
8. Pies & Coffee
 
Source
Damage: $6
If you love a pie but hate the mess of having it to-go, dine in at Pies & Coffee! With a menu that carries both sweet and savory pies priced between $6-12, it’s an ideal spot for a meal or snack. Savory pies are served with a side of mashed potatoes and salad greens. 
Address: The Centrepoint, 176 Orchard Road, #01-101-104, S(238843)  
 
9. Yonehachi 
 

Damage: $7.80
Meet Okowa rice, cousin of Lo Mai Kai,  only less greasy and of a Japanese descent. Each mouthful of the Salmon Okowa Rice Set ($7.80) was wholesome and tasty, best enjoyed with the side of pickles. This set comes in 4 other flavors and suit small to moderate eaters best. Go for the larger set meals with Unagi or Chicken Teriyaki if you’d like something more substantial. 
Tip: If you don’t have time to dine in, takeaway options are available too! 
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-1/2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
10. New Station Snack Bar
 

Damage: $6
This zi char shop is usually crowded and cramped, but discomfort is a small price to pay for my Salted Egg Pork Ribs Rice ($6). The pork ribs are soft and the salted egg sauce was easily the highlight of the dish. The curry leaves and chili padi gave it a tinge of spiciness, so it was creamy without being overly jelat. 
Tip: This dish is only on the Chinese menu so if you can’t read those characters to save your life, it’s No. 6. You’re welcome. 
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-95, S(228213)
 
11. Smoothie King 
 
Source
Damage: $6-7
On days when I’m feeling healthy, I try to avoid eye contact with the bubble tea shop and go to Smoothie King instead, where my first smoothie won half my heart just by being pastel-colored. 
A smoothie easily cost about $6-7, but the $9.90 set meal gets you an additional wrap or salad. It’s a triumph to score a meal in Orchard for $10, but to have it for under 500 calories is pure win! 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #01-14/15, S(238895)
 
12. Riverside Indonesian BBQ
 
Source
Damage: $6
Fans of the famous Indonesian BBQ Store in Plaza Singapura Kopitiam will be excited to know that 313 Somerset and Ion Orchard are homes to 2 other branches. With a specialty in the Ayam Panggang, the shop is known for using only fresh chicken.
After machine-dipping it into their signature black sauce, it’s served with steamed rice and topped with coconut curry. Most dishes, including squid and fish cooked with the same technique, cost around $6 on average. 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-44, S(238895)
 
13. Thai Tantric
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
Most people flock to Jane Thai at Orchard Towers, but its opening hours (evening only) are a real bummer. Thai Tantric’s opening hours (11am-3pm, 6pm-3am) are friendlier because no lust for Thai food should go unsatisfied. 
Popular dishes include Phad Thai ($6.50), Tom Yum Seafood Soup ($10) and Fried Glass Noodles with Seafood ($7), while most side dishes are priced below $10. Orchard Towers may not be the most pristine mall around, but great prices and authenticity rarely reside in upscale grounds and polished walls. 
Address: Orchard Towers, 400 Orchard Road, #03-23, S(238875)
 
14. Astons Specialities
 
Source
Damage: $6.90
Astons Specialties is a restaurant that requires no introduction, and one of the few I find worth queueing for. Apart from the steaks and chops, most pastas, burgers and fish dishes go for below $10. I love the flexibility in selecting sides, though I always find myself ending up with Mac & Cheese and Garden Vegetables. 
Address: #03-04 *SCAPE, 2 Orchard Link, S(237978)
 
15. Gyoza-Ya
 


Damage: $6.50
The Pan-fried Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had perfect skin - thin, crispy, and not too greasy. The chives and vegetable bits added texture to the sweet and soft pork filling. On the other hand, the Steamed Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had a soft and luscious exterior, served with their house special sauce. I personally preferred the former as I found the sauce to be a little too salty.  
This little-known place is ambient and surprisingly affordable. Sides are priced between $3.80-6.80, while mains cost $6.50-$6.80. It’s Robinsons’ well-kept secret!
Address: Robinsons Heeren, 260 Orchard Road, #B1-02A, S(238855)
 
16. River Valley Nasi Lemak 
 

Damage: $3.80
The cheapest of the lot is found at $3.80 at a remote corner of Lucky Plaza’s basement. I love the rice and chili best - foundation of any Nasi Lemak. The rice was some of the most fragrant I’ve tasted - each bite flavorful with coconut milk, perfect when paired with the sambal chili. The sides tasted average at best, but the variety is well worth the price. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #B1-99/101, S(238863)
 
17. Quiznos  
 

Damage: $6.90
As I unwrapped it my 6-inch Classic Italian Sub ($6.90), I judged it a little; it wasn’t the most good-looking sandwich. But the misunderstood sub soon redeemed itself.
The freshly toasted Rosemary Parmesan bread was so good it can be eaten on its own, appetizing with its aroma of herb and cheese combined. It would be perfect if the vegetables were fresher and crunchier, but the meats made up for it. Topped with mozzarella and red wine vinaigrette, the deli meats (pepperoni, salami, capicola and ham) were juicier and tastier than that of any other sub!
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #03-31, S(238896)
 
18. Jtown Cafe

Damage: Under $8
Jtown is an eatery located at the basement of Midpoint Orchard that serves Indonesian delicacies. Mains like the Bakmie Aya Bakso (pictured above) and the Black Pepper Bakso, which seems like the Indonesian version of Jajamen will cost you no more than $8, complete with a drink. There’s a variety of interesting Murtabak as well, with flavors like cheese, chocolate and even durian.

19. Eighteen Chefs

Damage: $6.40
Back when I was in school, 18 Chefs was a regular hangout. Today, the menu has grown about 3 times more extensive, but the student meal still costs $6.40 - a price I remember to be constant throughout these years. Even if you’re not a student, the “Be Your Own Chef” option remains a highly popular and customizable classic for baked rice and pastas below $10.

Damage: Under $10.
Unlike most Hong Kong cafes, this shop makes you stop in your tracks to admire the furnishing. With patterned tiles and grilles, old school celebrity posters and a soundtrack made up of Cantonese oldies, it’s clear that a lot of thought went into the creating an ambience. As most of the popular street food such as egg noodles and specialty toasts are priced affordably, you can easily dine for less than $10.
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #02-30, S(238896)
 
21. Greenview Cafe

In different shapes and sizes, the Mee Hoon Kueh Dry ($4.50) at Greenview Cafe is handmade, unlike the identical machine-cut squares sold at food courts. The thicker slices may not be for everyone, but I personally loved the Q-ness. The prawns (with an alternative of minced pork) were fresh and crisp while the sauce was the right amounts of sweet and salty, making this a favorite comfort food accessible in town.

Here’s something extra for those who’re willing to walk for cheap food. Which should mean everyone. 
Espuma Lab in PoMo features Michelin-style culinary methods like Espuma (foam) and Sous Vide (thermal circulator). Those are interesting techniques to pay attention to if you aren’t distracted by the prices yet.
Main courses are unbelievably priced at - get this - $6.80! Top-ups for a drink and a bowl of soup cost only $2. If you’re an all-day breakfast fanatic, this place also makes poached eggs with a side of Norwegian Salmon or Sauteed Mushrooms for less than $5!

Busting the Myth
 
There are many different ways people spend $10 in town these days. Some buy a Venti beverage because Starbucks’ Christmas Drinks can take all their money, while others join a froyo queue so long a security guard is stationed to manage it.

Cheap Food In Orchard Road 
 
Noble quests have always faced skepticism. 
Prior to my hunt for meals below $10 in Orchard Road, I surveyed my friends. Some looked at me as if I had just suggested we pool our savings to buy a unicorn. “Siao ah, this is Singapore babe”, they reminded me. One guy suggested McDonald’s. Oh, pure and utter audacity. 
Remember the days when Chicken Rice was $1? Me neither, but my parents would. Contrary to popular belief and common Singapore complaints, it’s possible to dine in Orchard Road without burning a hole in your pocket.
Here are 18 wallet-friendly meals you never knew about. 
 
1. Shi Li Fang Hotpot
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
At a price of $9.90++, choose from the Beef Tenderloin, Special Fish Head, Specialty Chicken/Pork Tenderloin, Pork Belly, Mushroom or Vegetables lunchtime (till 4pm) set meals. Each meal comes with a vegetables platter and a choice of handmade/egg noodles, rice or vermicelli. Also, every hotpot is personal so you reserve all rights to pick that soup base all your friends hate!
The total bill should come up to about $12 after tax, but what’s an extra few dollars when most hotpot restaurants in Orchard Road cost at least $30?
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #07-10/11, S(238896)
 
2. Tsuru-Koshi Udon
 

Damage: $10
From a selection of Udon and Donburi below $14, I ordered the Ebi Tempura Udon ($10). The soup was slightly salty without being overwhelming. The Udon was silky and smooth as promised when enjoyed with the Onsen Egg ($1). Though I would like my tempura to be crispier, this is the go-to place when you’re craving something hot and soupy. Many patrons are Japanese themselves!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B201-3, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
3. Hainanese Delicacy 
 

Damage: $4
I seriously suspect that I’m the only noob who has never tried this. I don’t care that it’s been reviewed to death! I need to gush about it once more to get it out of my system. 
Even though it was lunchtime, the line at Hainanese Delicacy moved quickly. I loved that the boneless meat of the Roasted Chicken Rice ($4) fully captured the sauce’s essence in its tender goodness, but it was the chilli that won me over. I don’t wanna jinx it, but this may be the best I’ve had.
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-116, S(228213)
 
4. Fisherios 
 

Damage: $7.90
Fisherios at Takashimaya Food Basement is hard to miss - with its inviting display of oysters and the smell of freshly fried fish. With a specialty in the Beer Battered Fish & Chips ($7.90), other house specials include Breaded fish ($8.90), Snapper ($9.90), Salmon ($9.90), and Shrimp ($8.90). This puts an end to paying $20 for a plate of fish & chips!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-4-2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
5. Dong Dae Mun
 

Damage: Sticks of meat from $1
Dong Dae Mun at Somerset 313 is the only outlet islandwide that serves meals like Kimchi Fried Rice and Korean Ramyun, within a dining space that fits about 12 people. 
The tantalising sight of sauce sizzling on the hot plate didn’t disappoint. Even though the chicken slices were thin, the portion was fairly large and well worth the money.

Also, rumor has it that the hotplate items are cooked with water instead of oil!
Address: #02-17/18 Concorde Hotel Singapore, 100 Orchard Road, S(238840)
 
7. Ayam Penyet Ria
 

Damage: $7.90
The Ayam Penyet ($7.90) was a mouth-watering sight - crumbs everywhere! Throughout the whole meal, I was that ridiculous emoji with heart shapes for eyes.  
The chefs mastered the art of deep-frying chicken - the skin was crispy but the thigh meat was still moist. It’s sinful but worth every calorie. You must order a drink because the chili was so intense, my tongue burned all the way from Lucky Plaza to Far East Plaza.

Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #07-10/11, S(238896)
 
2. Tsuru-Koshi Udon
 

Damage: $10
From a selection of Udon and Donburi below $14, I ordered the Ebi Tempura Udon ($10). The soup was slightly salty without being overwhelming. The Udon was silky and smooth as promised when enjoyed with the Onsen Egg ($1). Though I would like my tempura to be crispier, this is the go-to place when you’re craving something hot and soupy. Many patrons are Japanese themselves!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B201-3, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
3. Hainanese Delicacy 
 

Damage: $4
I seriously suspect that I’m the only noob who has never tried this. I don’t care that it’s been reviewed to death! I need to gush about it once more to get it out of my system. 
Even though it was lunchtime, the line at Hainanese Delicacy moved quickly. I loved that the boneless meat of the Roasted Chicken Rice ($4) fully captured the sauce’s essence in its tender goodness, but it was the chilli that won me over. I don’t wanna jinx it, but this may be the best I’ve had.
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-116, S(228213)
 
4. Fisherios 
 

Damage: $7.90
Fisherios at Takashimaya Food Basement is hard to miss - with its inviting display of oysters and the smell of freshly fried fish. With a specialty in the Beer Battered Fish & Chips ($7.90), other house specials include Breaded fish ($8.90), Snapper ($9.90), Salmon ($9.90), and Shrimp ($8.90). This puts an end to paying $20 for a plate of fish & chips!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-4-2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
5. Dong Dae Mun
 

Damage: Sticks of meat from $1
Dong Dae Mun at Somerset 313 is the only outlet islandwide that serves meals like Kimchi Fried Rice and Korean Ramyun, within a dining space that fits about 12 people. 
The tantalising sight of sauce sizzling on the hot plate didn’t disappoint. Even though the chicken slices were thin, the portion was fairly large and well worth the money.
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-49, S(238895)
 
6. Kim Dae Mun

Damage: Under $8
Further down the road is another Korean food spot to check out on the second floor of Concorde Hotel. There’s often a long queue in spite of its remote location, and it isn’t difficult to see why. Set meals and side dishes are priced below $8, and patrons have raved about the prices and authenticity.
Also, rumor has it that the hotplate items are cooked with water instead of oil!
Address: #02-17/18 Concorde Hotel Singapore, 100 Orchard Road, S(238840)
 
7. Ayam Penyet Ria
 

Damage: $7.90
The Ayam Penyet ($7.90) was a mouth-watering sight - crumbs everywhere! Throughout the whole meal, I was that ridiculous emoji with heart shapes for eyes.  
The chefs mastered the art of deep-frying chicken - the skin was crispy but the thigh meat was still moist. It’s sinful but worth every calorie. You must order a drink because the chili was so intense, my tongue burned all the way from Lucky Plaza to Far East Plaza. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #04-25, S(238863)
 
8. Pies & Coffee
 
Source
Damage: $6
If you love a pie but hate the mess of having it to-go, dine in at Pies & Coffee! With a menu that carries both sweet and savory pies priced between $6-12, it’s an ideal spot for a meal or snack. Savory pies are served with a side of mashed potatoes and salad greens. 
Address: The Centrepoint, 176 Orchard Road, #01-101-104, S(238843)  
 
9. Yonehachi 
 

Damage: $7.80
Meet Okowa rice, cousin of Lo Mai Kai,  only less greasy and of a Japanese descent. Each mouthful of the Salmon Okowa Rice Set ($7.80) was wholesome and tasty, best enjoyed with the side of pickles. This set comes in 4 other flavors and suit small to moderate eaters best. Go for the larger set meals with Unagi or Chicken Teriyaki if you’d like something more substantial. 
Tip: If you don’t have time to dine in, takeaway options are available too! 
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-1/2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
10. New Station Snack Bar
 

Damage: $6
This zi char shop is usually crowded and cramped, but discomfort is a small price to pay for my Salted Egg Pork Ribs Rice ($6). The pork ribs are soft and the salted egg sauce was easily the highlight of the dish. The curry leaves and chili padi gave it a tinge of spiciness, so it was creamy without being overly jelat. 
Tip: This dish is only on the Chinese menu so if you can’t read those characters to save your life, it’s No. 6. You’re welcome. 
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-95, S(228213)
 
11. Smoothie King 
 
Source
Damage: $6-7
On days when I’m feeling healthy, I try to avoid eye contact with the bubble tea shop and go to Smoothie King instead, where my first smoothie won half my heart just by being pastel-colored. 
A smoothie easily cost about $6-7, but the $9.90 set meal gets you an additional wrap or salad. It’s a triumph to score a meal in Orchard for $10, but to have it for under 500 calories is pure win! 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #01-14/15, S(238895)
 
12. Riverside Indonesian BBQ
 
Source
Damage: $6
Fans of the famous Indonesian BBQ Store in Plaza Singapura Kopitiam will be excited to know that 313 Somerset and Ion Orchard are homes to 2 other branches. With a specialty in the Ayam Panggang, the shop is known for using only fresh chicken.
After machine-dipping it into their signature black sauce, it’s served with steamed rice and topped with coconut curry. Most dishes, including squid and fish cooked with the same technique, cost around $6 on average. 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-44, S(238895)
 
13. Thai Tantric
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
Most people flock to Jane Thai at Orchard Towers, but its opening hours (evening only) are a real bummer. Thai Tantric’s opening hours (11am-3pm, 6pm-3am) are friendlier because no lust for Thai food should go unsatisfied. 
Popular dishes include Phad Thai ($6.50), Tom Yum Seafood Soup ($10) and Fried Glass Noodles with Seafood ($7), while most side dishes are priced below $10. Orchard Towers may not be the most pristine mall around, but great prices and authenticity rarely reside in upscale grounds and polished walls. 
Address: Orchard Towers, 400 Orchard Road, #03-23, S(238875)
 
14. Astons Specialities
 
Source
Damage: $6.90
Astons Specialties is a restaurant that requires no introduction, and one of the few I find worth queueing for. Apart from the steaks and chops, most pastas, burgers and fish dishes go for below $10. I love the flexibility in selecting sides, though I always find myself ending up with Mac & Cheese and Garden Vegetables. 
Address: #03-04 *SCAPE, 2 Orchard Link, S(237978)
 
15. Gyoza-Ya
 


Damage: $6.50
The Pan-fried Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had perfect skin - thin, crispy, and not too greasy. The chives and vegetable bits added texture to the sweet and soft pork filling. On the other hand, the Steamed Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had a soft and luscious exterior, served with their house special sauce. I personally preferred the former as I found the sauce to be a little too salty.  
This little-known place is ambient and surprisingly affordable. Sides are priced between $3.80-6.80, while mains cost $6.50-$6.80. It’s Robinsons’ well-kept secret!
Address: Robinsons Heeren, 260 Orchard Road, #B1-02A, S(238855)
 
16. River Valley Nasi Lemak 
 

Damage: $3.80
The cheapest of the lot is found at $3.80 at a remote corner of Lucky Plaza’s basement. I love the rice and chili best - foundation of any Nasi Lemak. The rice was some of the most fragrant I’ve tasted - each bite flavorful with coconut milk, perfect when paired with the sambal chili. The sides tasted average at best, but the variety is well worth the price. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #B1-99/101, S(238863)
 
17. Quiznos  
 

Damage: $6.90
As I unwrapped it my 6-inch Classic Italian Sub ($6.90), I judged it a little; it wasn’t the most good-looking sandwich. But the misunderstood sub soon redeemed itself.
The freshly toasted Rosemary Parmesan bread was so good it can be eaten on its own, appetizing with its aroma of herb and cheese combined. It would be perfect if the vegetables were fresher and crunchier, but the meats made up for it. Topped with mozzarella and red wine vinaigrette, the deli meats (pepperoni, salami, capicola and ham) were juicier and tastier than that of any other sub!
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #03-31, S(238896)
 
18. Jtown Cafe

Damage: Under $8
Jtown is an eatery located at the basement of Midpoint Orchard that serves Indonesian delicacies. Mains like the Bakmie Aya Bakso (pictured above) and the Black Pepper Bakso, which seems like the Indonesian version of Jajamen will cost you no more than $8, complete with a drink. There’s a variety of interesting Murtabak as well, with flavors like cheese, chocolate and even durian.

19. Eighteen Chefs 
 
Source
Damage: $6.40
Back when I was in school, 18 Chefs was a regular hangout. Today, the menu has grown about 3 times more extensive, but the student meal still costs $6.40 - a price I remember to be constant throughout these years. Even if you’re not a student, the “Be Your Own Chef” option remains a highly popular and customizable classic for baked rice and pastas below $10.
Address: #04-02 Cineleisure Orchard, 8 Grange Road, S(239695)
 
20. Central Hong Kong Cafe

Damage: Under $10.
Unlike most Hong Kong cafes, this shop makes you stop in your tracks to admire the furnishing. With patterned tiles and grilles, old school celebrity posters and a soundtrack made up of Cantonese oldies, it’s clear that a lot of thought went into the creating an ambience. As most of the popular street food such as egg noodles and specialty toasts are priced affordably, you can easily dine for less than $10.
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #02-30, S(238896)
 
21. Greenview Cafe
 

Damage: $4.50
In different shapes and sizes, the Mee Hoon Kueh Dry ($4.50) at Greenview Cafe is handmade, unlike the identical machine-cut squares sold at food courts. The thicker slices may not be for everyone, but I personally loved the Q-ness. The prawns (with an alternative of minced pork) were fresh and crisp while the sauce was the right amounts of sweet and salty, making this a favorite comfort food accessible in town.

Damage: $10
Ohsho is a Japanese casual dining joint located in Cuppage Plaza, within walking distance of Somerset MRT. In spite of its small size, the menu is quite extensive. Ramen here starts from $11, but for less than $10, you’d be able to get Yakiudon or Yakisoba, and a selection of rice dishes. For more value, look out for the set meals they offer!
Address: #01-10 Cuppage Plaza, 5 Koek Road, S(228796)
 
Bonus: Espuma Lab 
 
Source
Here’s something extra for those who’re willing to walk for cheap food. Which should mean everyone. 
Espuma Lab in PoMo features Michelin-style culinary methods like Espuma (foam) and Sous Vide (thermal circulator). Those are interesting techniques to pay attention to if you aren’t distracted by the prices yet.
Main courses are unbelievably priced at - get this - $6.80! Top-ups for a drink and a bowl of soup cost only $2. If you’re an all-day breakfast fanatic, this place also makes poached eggs with a side of Norwegian Salmon or Sauteed Mushrooms for less than $5!
Address: 1 Selegie Road, #01-20/21, PoMo,  S(188306)
 
Busting the Myth
 
There are many different ways people spend $10 in town these days. Some buy a Venti beverage because Starbucks’ Christmas Drinks can take all their money, while others join a froyo queue so long a security guard is stationed to manage it. 
If you can no longer enjoy the privilege of flashing your student card, it’s unlikely that $10 will get you much in today’s economy. We hope this article has helped you discover more choices in every nook and cranny of Orchard Road!

Cheap Food In Orchard Road 
 
Noble quests have always faced skepticism. 
Prior to my hunt for meals below $10 in Orchard Road, I surveyed my friends. Some looked at me as if I had just suggested we pool our savings to buy a unicorn. “Siao ah, this is Singapore babe”, they reminded me. One guy suggested McDonald’s. Oh, pure and utter audacity. 
Remember the days when Chicken Rice was $1? Me neither, but my parents would. Contrary to popular belief and common Singapore complaints, it’s possible to dine in Orchard Road without burning a hole in your pocket.
Here are 18 wallet-friendly meals you never knew about. 
 
1. Shi Li Fang Hotpot
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
At a price of $9.90++, choose from the Beef Tenderloin, Special Fish Head, Specialty Chicken/Pork Tenderloin, Pork Belly, Mushroom or Vegetables lunchtime (till 4pm) set meals. Each meal comes with a vegetables platter and a choice of handmade/egg noodles, rice or vermicelli. Also, every hotpot is personal so you reserve all rights to pick that soup base all your friends hate!
The total bill should come up to about $12 after tax, but what’s an extra few dollars when most hotpot restaurants in Orchard Road cost at least $30?
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #07-10/11, S(238896)
 
2. Tsuru-Koshi Udon
 

Damage: $10
From a selection of Udon and Donburi below $14, I ordered the Ebi Tempura Udon ($10). The soup was slightly salty without being overwhelming. The Udon was silky and smooth as promised when enjoyed with the Onsen Egg ($1). Though I would like my tempura to be crispier, this is the go-to place when you’re craving something hot and soupy. Many patrons are Japanese themselves!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B201-3, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
3. Hainanese Delicacy 
 

Damage: $4
I seriously suspect that I’m the only noob who has never tried this. I don’t care that it’s been reviewed to death! I need to gush about it once more to get it out of my system. 
Even though it was lunchtime, the line at Hainanese Delicacy moved quickly. I loved that the boneless meat of the Roasted Chicken Rice ($4) fully captured the sauce’s essence in its tender goodness, but it was the chilli that won me over. I don’t wanna jinx it, but this may be the best I’ve had.
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-116, S(228213)
 
4. Fisherios 
 

Damage: $7.90
Fisherios at Takashimaya Food Basement is hard to miss - with its inviting display of oysters and the smell of freshly fried fish. With a specialty in the Beer Battered Fish & Chips ($7.90), other house specials include Breaded fish ($8.90), Snapper ($9.90), Salmon ($9.90), and Shrimp ($8.90). This puts an end to paying $20 for a plate of fish & chips!

16. River Valley Nasi Lemak 
 

Damage: $3.80
The cheapest of the lot is found at $3.80 at a remote corner of Lucky Plaza’s basement. I love the rice and chili best - foundation of any Nasi Lemak. The rice was some of the most fragrant I’ve tasted - each bite flavorful with coconut milk, perfect when paired with the sambal chili. The sides tasted average at best, but the variety is well worth the price.

17. Quiznos  
 

Damage: $6.90
As I unwrapped it my 6-inch Classic Italian Sub ($6.90), I judged it a little; it wasn’t the most good-looking sandwich. But the misunderstood sub soon redeemed itself.
The freshly toasted Rosemary Parmesan bread was so good it can be eaten on its own, appetizing with its aroma of herb and cheese combined. It would be perfect if the vegetables were fresher and crunchier, but the meats made up for it. Topped with mozzarella and red wine vinaigrette, the deli meats (pepperoni, salami, capicola and ham) were juicier and tastier than that of any other sub!

In different shapes and sizes, the Mee Hoon Kueh Dry ($4.50) at Greenview Cafe is handmade, unlike the identical machine-cut squares sold at food courts. The thicker slices may not be for everyone, but I personally loved the Q-ness. The prawns (with an alternative of minced pork) were fresh and crisp while the sauce was the right amounts of sweet and salty, making this a favorite comfort food accessible in town.

Here’s something extra for those who’re willing to walk for cheap food. Which should mean everyone. 
Espuma Lab in PoMo features Michelin-style culinary methods like Espuma (foam) and Sous Vide (thermal circulator). Those are interesting techniques to pay attention to if you aren’t distracted by the prices yet.

Busting the Myth
 
There are many different ways people spend $10 in town these days. Some buy a Venti beverage because Starbucks’ Christmas Drinks can take all their money, while others join a froyo queue so long a security guard is stationed to manage it. 
If you can no longer enjoy the privilege of flashing your student card, it’s unlikely that $10 will get you much in today’s economy. We hope this article has helped you discover more choices in every nook and cranny of Orchard Road!

Cheap Food In Orchard Road 
 
Noble quests have always faced skepticism. 
Prior to my hunt for meals below $10 in Orchard Road, I surveyed my friends. Some looked at me as if I had just suggested we pool our savings to buy a unicorn. “Siao ah, this is Singapore babe”, they reminded me. One guy suggested McDonald’s. Oh, pure and utter audacity. 
Remember the days when Chicken Rice was $1? Me neither, but my parents would. Contrary to popular belief and common Singapore complaints, it’s possible to dine in Orchard Road without burning a hole in your pocket.
Here are 18 wallet-friendly meals you never knew about. 
 
1. Shi Li Fang Hotpot
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
At a price of $9.90++, choose from the Beef Tenderloin, Special Fish Head, Specialty Chicken/Pork Tenderloin, Pork Belly, Mushroom or Vegetables lunchtime (till 4pm) set meals. Each meal comes with a vegetables platter and a choice of handmade/egg noodles, rice or vermicelli. Also, every hotpot is personal so you reserve all rights to pick that soup base all your friends hate!
The total bill should come up to about $12 after tax, but what’s an extra few dollars when most hotpot restaurants in Orchard Road cost at least $30?
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #07-10/11, S(238896)
 
2. Tsuru-Koshi Udon
 

Damage: $10
From a selection of Udon and Donburi below $14, I ordered the Ebi Tempura Udon ($10). The soup was slightly salty without being overwhelming. The Udon was silky and smooth as promised when enjoyed with the Onsen Egg ($1). Though I would like my tempura to be crispier, this is the go-to place when you’re craving something hot and soupy. Many patrons are Japanese themselves!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B201-3, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
3. Hainanese Delicacy 
 

Damage: $4
I seriously suspect that I’m the only noob who has never tried this. I don’t care that it’s been reviewed to death! I need to gush about it once more to get it out of my system. 
Even though it was lunchtime, the line at Hainanese Delicacy moved quickly. I loved that the boneless meat of the Roasted Chicken Rice ($4) fully captured the sauce’s essence in its tender goodness, but it was the chilli that won me over. I don’t wanna jinx it, but this may be the best I’ve had.
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-116, S(228213)
 
4. Fisherios 
 

Damage: $7.90
Fisherios at Takashimaya Food Basement is hard to miss - with its inviting display of oysters and the smell of freshly fried fish. With a specialty in the Beer Battered Fish & Chips ($7.90), other house specials include Breaded fish ($8.90), Snapper ($9.90), Salmon ($9.90), and Shrimp ($8.90). This puts an end to paying $20 for a plate of fish & chips!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-4-2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
5. Dong Dae Mun
 

Damage: Sticks of meat from $1
Dong Dae Mun at Somerset 313 is the only outlet islandwide that serves meals like Kimchi Fried Rice and Korean Ramyun, within a dining space that fits about 12 people. 
The tantalising sight of sauce sizzling on the hot plate didn’t disappoint. Even though the chicken slices were thin, the portion was fairly large and well worth the money.
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-49, S(238895)
 
6. Kim Dae Mun
 
Source
Damage: Under $8
Further down the road is another Korean food spot to check out on the second floor of Concorde Hotel. There’s often a long queue in spite of its remote location, and it isn’t difficult to see why. Set meals and side dishes are priced below $8, and patrons have raved about the prices and authenticity.
Also, rumor has it that the hotplate items are cooked with water instead of oil!
Address: #02-17/18 Concorde Hotel Singapore, 100 Orchard Road, S(238840)
 
7. Ayam Penyet Ria
 

Damage: $7.90
The Ayam Penyet ($7.90) was a mouth-watering sight - crumbs everywhere! Throughout the whole meal, I was that ridiculous emoji with heart shapes for eyes.  
The chefs mastered the art of deep-frying chicken - the skin was crispy but the thigh meat was still moist. It’s sinful but worth every calorie. You must order a drink because the chili was so intense, my tongue burned all the way from Lucky Plaza to Far East Plaza. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #04-25, S(238863)
 
8. Pies & Coffee
 
Source
Damage: $6
If you love a pie but hate the mess of having it to-go, dine in at Pies & Coffee! With a menu that carries both sweet and savory pies priced between $6-12, it’s an ideal spot for a meal or snack. Savory pies are served with a side of mashed potatoes and salad greens. 
Address: The Centrepoint, 176 Orchard Road, #01-101-104, S(238843)  
 
9. Yonehachi 
 

Damage: $7.80
Meet Okowa rice, cousin of Lo Mai Kai,  only less greasy and of a Japanese descent. Each mouthful of the Salmon Okowa Rice Set ($7.80) was wholesome and tasty, best enjoyed with the side of pickles. This set comes in 4 other flavors and suit small to moderate eaters best. Go for the larger set meals with Unagi or Chicken Teriyaki if you’d like something more substantial. 
Tip: If you don’t have time to dine in, takeaway options are available too! 
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-1/2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
10. New Station Snack Bar
 

Damage: $6
This zi char shop is usually crowded and cramped, but discomfort is a small price to pay for my Salted Egg Pork Ribs Rice ($6). The pork ribs are soft and the salted egg sauce was easily the highlight of the dish. The curry leaves and chili padi gave it a tinge of spiciness, so it was creamy without being overly jelat. 
Tip: This dish is only on the Chinese menu so if you can’t read those characters to save your life, it’s No. 6. You’re welcome. 
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-95, S(228213)
 
11. Smoothie King 
 
Source
Damage: $6-7
On days when I’m feeling healthy, I try to avoid eye contact with the bubble tea shop and go to Smoothie King instead, where my first smoothie won half my heart just by being pastel-colored. 
A smoothie easily cost about $6-7, but the $9.90 set meal gets you an additional wrap or salad. It’s a triumph to score a meal in Orchard for $10, but to have it for under 500 calories is pure win! 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #01-14/15, S(238895)
 
12. Riverside Indonesian BBQ
 
Source
Damage: $6
Fans of the famous Indonesian BBQ Store in Plaza Singapura Kopitiam will be excited to know that 313 Somerset and Ion Orchard are homes to 2 other branches. With a specialty in the Ayam Panggang, the shop is known for using only fresh chicken.
After machine-dipping it into their signature black sauce, it’s served with steamed rice and topped with coconut curry. Most dishes, including squid and fish cooked with the same technique, cost around $6 on average. 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-44, S(238895)
 
13. Thai Tantric
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
Most people flock to Jane Thai at Orchard Towers, but its opening hours (evening only) are a real bummer. Thai Tantric’s opening hours (11am-3pm, 6pm-3am) are friendlier because no lust for Thai food should go unsatisfied. 
Popular dishes include Phad Thai ($6.50), Tom Yum Seafood Soup ($10) and Fried Glass Noodles with Seafood ($7), while most side dishes are priced below $10. Orchard Towers may not be the most pristine mall around, but great prices and authenticity rarely reside in upscale grounds and polished walls. 
Address: Orchard Towers, 400 Orchard Road, #03-23, S(238875)
 
14. Astons Specialities
 
Source
Damage: $6.90
Astons Specialties is a restaurant that requires no introduction, and one of the few I find worth queueing for. Apart from the steaks and chops, most pastas, burgers and fish dishes go for below $10. I love the flexibility in selecting sides, though I always find myself ending up with Mac & Cheese and Garden Vegetables. 
Address: #03-04 *SCAPE, 2 Orchard Link, S(237978)
 
15. Gyoza-Ya
 


Damage: $6.50
The Pan-fried Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had perfect skin - thin, crispy, and not too greasy. The chives and vegetable bits added texture to the sweet and soft pork filling. On the other hand, the Steamed Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had a soft and luscious exterior, served with their house special sauce. I personally preferred the former as I found the sauce to be a little too salty.  
This little-known place is ambient and surprisingly affordable. Sides are priced between $3.80-6.80, while mains cost $6.50-$6.80. It’s Robinsons’ well-kept secret!
Address: Robinsons Heeren, 260 Orchard Road, #B1-02A, S(238855)
 
16. River Valley Nasi Lemak 
 

Damage: $3.80
The cheapest of the lot is found at $3.80 at a remote corner of Lucky Plaza’s basement. I love the rice and chili best - foundation of any Nasi Lemak. The rice was some of the most fragrant I’ve tasted - each bite flavorful with coconut milk, perfect when paired with the sambal chili. The sides tasted average at best, but the variety is well worth the price. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #B1-99/101, S(238863)
 
17. Quiznos  
 

Damage: $6.90
As I unwrapped it my 6-inch Classic Italian Sub ($6.90), I judged it a little; it wasn’t the most good-looking sandwich. But the misunderstood sub soon redeemed itself.
The freshly toasted Rosemary Parmesan bread was so good it can be eaten on its own, appetizing with its aroma of herb and cheese combined. It would be perfect if the vegetables were fresher and crunchier, but the meats made up for it. Topped with mozzarella and red wine vinaigrette, the deli meats (pepperoni, salami, capicola and ham) were juicier and tastier than that of any other sub!
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #03-31, S(238896)
 
18. Jtown Cafe
 
SourceSource
Damage: Under $8
Jtown is an eatery located at the basement of Midpoint Orchard that serves Indonesian delicacies. Mains like the Bakmie Aya Bakso (pictured above) and the Black Pepper Bakso, which seems like the Indonesian version of Jajamen will cost you no more than $8, complete with a drink. There’s a variety of interesting Murtabak as well, with flavors like cheese, chocolate and even durian.
Address:#B1-04/05 Midpoint Orchard, 220 Orchard Road, S(238852)
 
19. Eighteen Chefs 
 
Source
Damage: $6.40
Back when I was in school, 18 Chefs was a regular hangout. Today, the menu has grown about 3 times more extensive, but the student meal still costs $6.40 - a price I remember to be constant throughout these years. Even if you’re not a student, the “Be Your Own Chef” option remains a highly popular and customizable classic for baked rice and pastas below $10.
Address: #04-02 Cineleisure Orchard, 8 Grange Road, S(239695)
 
20. Central Hong Kong Cafe
 
Source
Damage: Under $10.
Unlike most Hong Kong cafes, this shop makes you stop in your tracks to admire the furnishing. With patterned tiles and grilles, old school celebrity posters and a soundtrack made up of Cantonese oldies, it’s clear that a lot of thought went into the creating an ambience. As most of the popular street food such as egg noodles and specialty toasts are priced affordably, you can easily dine for less than $10.
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #02-30, S(238896)
 
21. Greenview Cafe
 

Damage: $4.50
In different shapes and sizes, the Mee Hoon Kueh Dry ($4.50) at Greenview Cafe is handmade, unlike the identical machine-cut squares sold at food courts. The thicker slices may not be for everyone, but I personally loved the Q-ness. The prawns (with an alternative of minced pork) were fresh and crisp while the sauce was the right amounts of sweet and salty, making this a favorite comfort food accessible in town. 
Address: Far East Plaza, 14 Scotts Road, #04-96, S(228213)
 
22. Gyoza no Ohsho
 
Source
Damage: $10
Ohsho is a Japanese casual dining joint located in Cuppage Plaza, within walking distance of Somerset MRT. In spite of its small size, the menu is quite extensive. Ramen here starts from $11, but for less than $10, you’d be able to get Yakiudon or Yakisoba, and a selection of rice dishes. For more value, look out for the set meals they offer!
Address: #01-10 Cuppage Plaza, 5 Koek Road, S(228796)
 
Bonus: Espuma Lab 
 
Source
Here’s something extra for those who’re willing to walk for cheap food. Which should mean everyone. 
Espuma Lab in PoMo features Michelin-style culinary methods like Espuma (foam) and Sous Vide (thermal circulator). Those are interesting techniques to pay attention to if you aren’t distracted by the prices yet.
Main courses are unbelievably priced at - get this - $6.80! Top-ups for a drink and a bowl of soup cost only $2. If you’re an all-day breakfast fanatic, this place also makes poached eggs with a side of Norwegian Salmon or Sauteed Mushrooms for less than $5!
Address: 1 Selegie Road, #01-20/21, PoMo,  S(188306)
 
Busting the Myth
 
There are many different ways people spend $10 in town these days. Some buy a Venti beverage because Starbucks’ Christmas Drinks can take all their money, while others join a froyo queue so long a security guard is stationed to manage it. 
If you can no longer enjoy the privilege of flashing your student card, it’s unlikely that $10 will get you much in today’s economy. We hope this article has helped you discover more choices in every nook and cranny of Orchard Road!
In fact, if you’re savvy enough, you may even have money left for dessert: Source

I love the flexibility in selecting sides, though I always find myself ending up with Mac & Cheese and Garden Vegetables. 
Address: #03-04 *SCAPE, 2 Orchard Link, S(237978)
 
15. Gyoza-Ya
 


Damage: $6.50
The Pan-fried Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had perfect skin - thin, crispy, and not too greasy. The chives and vegetable bits added texture to the sweet and soft pork filling. On the other hand, the Steamed Pork Gyoza ($4.80) had a soft and luscious exterior, served with their house special sauce. I personally preferred the former as I found the sauce to be a little too salty.  
This little-known place is ambient and surprisingly affordable. Sides are priced between $3.80-6.80, while mains cost $6.50-$6.80. It’s Robinsons’ well-kept secret!
Address: Robinsons Heeren, 260 Orchard Road, #B1-02A, S(238855)
 
16. River Valley Nasi Lemak 
 

Damage: $3.80
The cheapest of the lot is found at $3.80 at a remote corner of Lucky Plaza’s basement. I love the rice and chili best - foundation of any Nasi Lemak. The rice was some of the most fragrant I’ve tasted - each bite flavorful with coconut milk, perfect when paired with the sambal chili. The sides tasted average at best, but the variety is well worth the price. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #B1-99/101, S(238863)
 
17. Quiznos  
 

Damage: $6.90
As I unwrapped it my 6-inch Classic Italian Sub ($6.90), I judged it a little; it wasn’t the most good-looking sandwich. But the misunderstood sub soon redeemed itself.
The freshly toasted Rosemary Parmesan bread was so good it can be eaten on its own, appetizing with its aroma of herb and cheese combined. It would be perfect if the vegetables were fresher and crunchier, but the meats made up for it. Topped with mozzarella and red wine vinaigrette, the deli meats (pepperoni, salami, capicola and ham) were juicier and tastier than that of any other sub!
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #03-31, S(238896)
 
18. Jtown Cafe
 
SourceSource
Damage: Under $8
Jtown is an eatery located at the basement of Midpoint Orchard that serves Indonesian delicacies. Mains like the Bakmie Aya Bakso (pictured above) and the Black Pepper Bakso, which seems like the Indonesian version of Jajamen will cost you no more than $8, complete with a drink. There’s a variety of interesting Murtabak as well, with flavors like cheese, chocolate and even durian.
Address:#B1-04/05 Midpoint Orchard, 220 Orchard Road, S(238852)
 
19. Eighteen Chefs 
 
Source
Damage: $6.40
Back when I was in school, 18 Chefs was a regular hangout. Today, the menu has grown about 3 times more extensive, but the student meal still costs $6.40 - a price I remember to be constant throughout these years. Even if you’re not a student, the “Be Your Own Chef” option remains a highly popular and customizable classic for baked rice and pastas below $10.
Address: #04-02 Cineleisure Orchard, 8 Grange Road, S(239695)
 
20. Central Hong Kong Cafe
 
Source
Damage: Under $10.
Unlike most Hong Kong cafes, this shop makes you stop in your tracks to admire the furnishing. With patterned tiles and grilles, old school celebrity posters and a soundtrack made up of Cantonese oldies, it’s clear that a lot of thought went into the creating an ambience. As most of the popular street food such as egg noodles and specialty toasts are priced affordably, you can easily dine for less than $10.
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #02-30, S(238896)
 
21. Greenview Cafe
 

Damage: $4.50
In different shapes and sizes, the Mee Hoon Kueh Dry ($4.50) at Greenview Cafe is handmade, unlike the identical machine-cut squares sold at food courts. The thicker slices may not be for everyone, but I personally loved the Q-ness. The prawns (with an alternative of minced pork) were fresh and crisp while the sauce was the right amounts of sweet and salty, making this a favorite comfort food accessible in town. 
Address: Far East Plaza, 14 Scotts Road, #04-96, S(228213)
 
22. Gyoza no Ohsho
 
Source
Damage: $10
Ohsho is a Japanese casual dining joint located in Cuppage Plaza, within walking distance of Somerset MRT. In spite of its small size, the menu is quite extensive. Ramen here starts from $11, but for less than $10, you’d be able to get Yakiudon or Yakisoba, and a selection of rice dishes. For more value, look out for the set meals they offer!
Address: #01-10 Cuppage Plaza, 5 Koek Road, S(228796)
 
Bonus: Espuma Lab 
 
Source
Here’s something extra for those who’re willing to walk for cheap food. Which should mean everyone. 
Espuma Lab in PoMo features Michelin-style culinary methods like Espuma (foam) and Sous Vide (thermal circulator). Those are interesting techniques to pay attention to if you aren’t distracted by the prices yet.
Main courses are unbelievably priced at - get this - $6.80! Top-ups for a drink and a bowl of soup cost only $2. If you’re an all-day breakfast fanatic, this place also makes poached eggs with a side of Norwegian Salmon or Sauteed Mushrooms for less than $5!
Address: 1 Selegie Road, #01-20/21, PoMo,  S(188306)
 
Busting the Myth
 
There are many different ways people spend $10 in town these days. Some buy a Venti beverage because Starbucks’ Christmas Drinks can take all their money, while others join a froyo queue so long a security guard is stationed to manage it. 
If you can no longer enjoy the privilege of flashing your student card, it’s unlikely that $10 will get you much in today’s economy. We hope this article has helped you discover more choices in every nook and cranny of Orchard Road!
In fact, if you’re savvy enough, you may even have money left for dessert: Source

Cheap Food In Orchard Road 
 
Noble quests have always faced skepticism. 
Prior to my hunt for meals below $10 in Orchard Road, I surveyed my friends. Some looked at me as if I had just suggested we pool our savings to buy a unicorn. “Siao ah, this is Singapore babe”, they reminded me. One guy suggested McDonald’s. Oh, pure and utter audacity. 
Remember the days when Chicken Rice was $1? Me neither, but my parents would. Contrary to popular belief and common Singapore complaints, it’s possible to dine in Orchard Road without burning a hole in your pocket.
Here are 18 wallet-friendly meals you never knew about. 
 
1. Shi Li Fang Hotpot
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
At a price of $9.90++, choose from the Beef Tenderloin, Special Fish Head, Specialty Chicken/Pork Tenderloin, Pork Belly, Mushroom or Vegetables lunchtime (till 4pm) set meals. Each meal comes with a vegetables platter and a choice of handmade/egg noodles, rice or vermicelli. Also, every hotpot is personal so you reserve all rights to pick that soup base all your friends hate!
The total bill should come up to about $12 after tax, but what’s an extra few dollars when most hotpot restaurants in Orchard Road cost at least $30?
Address: Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road, #07-10/11, S(238896)
 
2. Tsuru-Koshi Udon
 

Damage: $10
From a selection of Udon and Donburi below $14, I ordered the Ebi Tempura Udon ($10). The soup was slightly salty without being overwhelming. The Udon was silky and smooth as promised when enjoyed with the Onsen Egg ($1). Though I would like my tempura to be crispier, this is the go-to place when you’re craving something hot and soupy. Many patrons are Japanese themselves!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B201-3, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
3. Hainanese Delicacy 
 

Damage: $4
I seriously suspect that I’m the only noob who has never tried this. I don’t care that it’s been reviewed to death! I need to gush about it once more to get it out of my system. 
Even though it was lunchtime, the line at Hainanese Delicacy moved quickly. I loved that the boneless meat of the Roasted Chicken Rice ($4) fully captured the sauce’s essence in its tender goodness, but it was the chilli that won me over. I don’t wanna jinx it, but this may be the best I’ve had.
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-116, S(228213)
 
4. Fisherios 
 

Damage: $7.90
Fisherios at Takashimaya Food Basement is hard to miss - with its inviting display of oysters and the smell of freshly fried fish. With a specialty in the Beer Battered Fish & Chips ($7.90), other house specials include Breaded fish ($8.90), Snapper ($9.90), Salmon ($9.90), and Shrimp ($8.90). This puts an end to paying $20 for a plate of fish & chips!
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-4-2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
5. Dong Dae Mun
 

Damage: Sticks of meat from $1
Dong Dae Mun at Somerset 313 is the only outlet islandwide that serves meals like Kimchi Fried Rice and Korean Ramyun, within a dining space that fits about 12 people. 
The tantalising sight of sauce sizzling on the hot plate didn’t disappoint. Even though the chicken slices were thin, the portion was fairly large and well worth the money.
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-49, S(238895)
 
6. Kim Dae Mun
 
Source
Damage: Under $8
Further down the road is another Korean food spot to check out on the second floor of Concorde Hotel. There’s often a long queue in spite of its remote location, and it isn’t difficult to see why. Set meals and side dishes are priced below $8, and patrons have raved about the prices and authenticity.
Also, rumor has it that the hotplate items are cooked with water instead of oil!
Address: #02-17/18 Concorde Hotel Singapore, 100 Orchard Road, S(238840)
 
7. Ayam Penyet Ria
 

Damage: $7.90
The Ayam Penyet ($7.90) was a mouth-watering sight - crumbs everywhere! Throughout the whole meal, I was that ridiculous emoji with heart shapes for eyes.  
The chefs mastered the art of deep-frying chicken - the skin was crispy but the thigh meat was still moist. It’s sinful but worth every calorie. You must order a drink because the chili was so intense, my tongue burned all the way from Lucky Plaza to Far East Plaza. 
Address: Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road, #04-25, S(238863)
 
8. Pies & Coffee
 
Source
Damage: $6
If you love a pie but hate the mess of having it to-go, dine in at Pies & Coffee! With a menu that carries both sweet and savory pies priced between $6-12, it’s an ideal spot for a meal or snack. Savory pies are served with a side of mashed potatoes and salad greens. 
Address: The Centrepoint, 176 Orchard Road, #01-101-104, S(238843)  
 
9. Yonehachi 
 

Damage: $7.80
Meet Okowa rice, cousin of Lo Mai Kai,  only less greasy and of a Japanese descent. Each mouthful of the Salmon Okowa Rice Set ($7.80) was wholesome and tasty, best enjoyed with the side of pickles. This set comes in 4 other flavors and suit small to moderate eaters best. Go for the larger set meals with Unagi or Chicken Teriyaki if you’d like something more substantial. 
Tip: If you don’t have time to dine in, takeaway options are available too! 
Address: Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Road #B204-1/2, Takashimaya Food Hall, S(238872) 
 
10. New Station Snack Bar
 

Damage: $6
This zi char shop is usually crowded and cramped, but discomfort is a small price to pay for my Salted Egg Pork Ribs Rice ($6). The pork ribs are soft and the salted egg sauce was easily the highlight of the dish. The curry leaves and chili padi gave it a tinge of spiciness, so it was creamy without being overly jelat. 
Tip: This dish is only on the Chinese menu so if you can’t read those characters to save your life, it’s No. 6. You’re welcome. 
Address: Far East Plaza,  14 Scotts Road, #05-95, S(228213)
 
11. Smoothie King 
 
Source
Damage: $6-7
On days when I’m feeling healthy, I try to avoid eye contact with the bubble tea shop and go to Smoothie King instead, where my first smoothie won half my heart just by being pastel-colored. 
A smoothie easily cost about $6-7, but the $9.90 set meal gets you an additional wrap or salad. It’s a triumph to score a meal in Orchard for $10, but to have it for under 500 calories is pure win! 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #01-14/15, S(238895)
 
12. Riverside Indonesian BBQ
 
Source
Damage: $6
Fans of the famous Indonesian BBQ Store in Plaza Singapura Kopitiam will be excited to know that 313 Somerset and Ion Orchard are homes to 2 other branches. With a specialty in the Ayam Panggang, the shop is known for using only fresh chicken.
After machine-dipping it into their signature black sauce, it’s served with steamed rice and topped with coconut curry. Most dishes, including squid and fish cooked with the same technique, cost around $6 on average. 
Address: 313@Somerset, 313 Orchard Road, #B3-44, S(238895)
 
13. Thai Tantric
 
Source
Damage: $9.90
Most people flock to Jane Thai at Orchard Towers, but its opening hours (evening only) are a real bummer. Thai Tantric’s opening hours (11am-3pm, 6pm-3am) are friendlier because no lust for Thai food should go unsatisfied. 
Popular dishes include Phad Thai ($6.50), Tom Yum Seafood Soup ($10) and Fried Glass Noodles with Seafood ($7), while most side dishes are priced below $10. Orchard Towers may not be the most pristine mall around, but great prices and authenticity rarely reside in upscale grounds and polished walls. 
Address: Orchard Towers, 400 Orchard Road, #03-23, S(238875)
 
14. Astons Specialities

Damage: $6.90
Astons Specialties is a restaurant that requires no introduction, and one of the few I find worth queueing for. Apart from the steaks and chops, most pastas, burgers and fish dishes go for below $10. I love the flexibility in selecting sides, though I always find myself ending up with Mac & Cheese and Garden Vegetables. 
Address: #03-04 *SCAPE, 2 Orchard Link, S(237978)

You’ll find the Kueh Pie Tee from your annual reunion dinners, and all your favourite seafood like chilli crab and black pepper crayfish - savour them all during the Wok Fare Seafood Weekend Lunch ($35++, U.P $70++) from 1 Mar - 31 Mar 2018.

 Cheap buffets in Orchard 
 
Dining at some fancy places in Orchard usually burns a hole in your pocket. But with so many buffets in town available at 50% off with Eatigo, you’d be spoilt for choice as to where to go.

Another plus: there’ll be no nasty surprises from the fine print either - like with minimum spend of $150. Just download the app from Apple’s App Store or Google’s Play store, choose your preferred timing and confirm your reservation. Turn up at the restaurant at the reserved time, inform the staff of your reservation and you’re all set for a discounted buffet. 
The next time bae suggests eating somewhere fancy, you know what to do!  
More Orchard dining options at up to 50% off here!

You’ll find the Kueh Pie Tee from your annual reunion dinners, and all your favourite seafood like chilli crab and black pepper crayfish - savour them all during the Wok Fare Seafood Weekend Lunch ($35++, U.P $70++) from 1 Mar - 31 Mar 2018.

 Cheap buffets in Orchard 
 
Dining at some fancy places in Orchard usually burns a hole in your pocket. But with so many buffets in town available at 50% off with Eatigo, you’d be spoilt for choice as to where to go.

Another plus: there’ll be no nasty surprises from the fine print either - like with minimum spend of $150. Just download the app from Apple’s App Store or Google’s Play store, choose your preferred timing and confirm your reservation. Turn up at the restaurant at the reserved time, inform the staff of your reservation and you’re all set for a discounted buffet. 
The next time bae suggests eating somewhere fancy, you know what to do!  
More Orchard dining options at up to 50% off here!

The Best Non-GST Restaurants in Singapore
 
You know that tiny script at the end of the menu that sneakily declares ""Prices subject to GST and service tax."" I don't know about you, but when I'm blinded by hunger I tend to miss it. And then when my bill arrives and I notice the additional costs, I die a little bit inside.
In order for that to never ever happen again, here's a list of 18 Singapore restaurants that do not charge GST or Service tax!
 
1. Pepperoni Pizzeria
 
Source: @biteclubsg
To me, the only thing better than pizza is a huge pizza. I'm talking about a XXL 21 inch pizza. Add to that no service charge or GST, and you've got a fool-proof restaurant idea for friends, family and anyone in between. The TSL crew hangs out a lot here because it is so near our office, and one $50 NETT pizza can be easily shared between 5 people.
Address: 56 Zion Road, Singapore 247781 | 6 Greenwood Avenue, Hillcrest Park, Singapore 289195
 
2. Nam Nam Noodle Bar
 
Source: @namnamnoodlebar
Vietnamese food is not only incredibly tasty, the ingredients used are also really light. If you're in town and looking for affordable, healthy food, head to Nam Nam. They even have an awesome set lunch menu!
Address: 252 North Bridge Road, Singapore 179103
 
3. La Petite Cuisine
 
Source: @monkiepoo
Yup, this just in - French food no longer has to cost a fortune. This restaurant aims to serve no-frills French fare at a super affordable price. This restaurant was also featured in our list of 18 Most Delicious Restaurants Under 15 Dollars.
Address: 10 Jalan Serene, Serene Centre #01-05, Singapore 258748
 
4. The ART
 
 Source: The ART
ART stands for the Assumption Restaurant for Training, where they provide a working environment for the aspiring future chefs among the students of the Assumption Pathway School (APS). Eating here means great food at affordable prices! 
Address: 30 Cashew Road, Singapore 679697
 
5. Food For Thought
 
Source: @georgianalee
Embrace your inner hippie as you head into Food For Thought. As their name suggests, they're all about good food for a good cause. Currently, their causes include providing clean water and ending poverty.
Address: 1 Cluny Road, Tanglin Gate #B1-00, Singapore 259569
 
6. OKB
 
Source: OKB
 
OKB stands for 2 things. 1. One Kampung Bahru (the address of this joint) and 2. Our Kind of Bar, Bistro, Bakery. Having received rave reviews for its baked goods, this place is now being thrust into the limelight again for their other dishes. Expect European food with an Asian twist. 
Address: 1 Kampung Bahru Road, Singapore 169339
 
7. Rice & Fries
 
Source: @ricenfries
For those living in the East, this place is a must try. For those who think the only thing in the East is Changi Airport, give this place a shot, and then we'll talk. This restaurant dishes up simple fare in an unpretentious environment, so the food here takes centre stage. 
Address: 484 Changi Road, Singapore 419896
 
8. Jag's Gastropub
 
Source: Jag's Gastropub
Not only does this place serve your usual pub grub, they also serve an array of entrees to accompany your beer. It's a great place to unwind and chill after a tiring work day with your buddies.
Address: 922 East Coast Road, Singapore 459114
 
9. The French Ladle
 
 Source: The French Ladle
This is another place serving affordable French fare. This place is intimate and super homey so it's a wonderful place to head to with your main squeeze for some awesome food - and you won't have to worry about your heart breaking when you see the bill.
Address: 2 Pandan Valley, Singapore 597626
 
10. SPRMRKT
 
Source: @chrissiekoh
This place spices up your supermarket experience by providing food, retail and art. That's right, artists are allowed to showcase their work here for public enjoyment, as well as for sale. You can also visit if you're looking out for for new items to jazz up your work or living space.
Address: 2 McCallum Street, Singapore 069043
 
11. The Sushi Bar
 
Source: @waanping
This list would be incomplete without at least one Japanese place and this one takes the cake. The sushi here not only tastes amazing but is super affordable as well. It's a great place to dine with friends. The only downside is the queues can get pretty darn long.
Address: 14 Scotts Road, Far East Plaza #03-89, Singapore 228213
 
12. Casa Verde
 
Source: Eat, Shop, Blog
Case Verde actually means ""green house"" in Italian. No, you won't be dining in an actual greenhouse. The name comes from the fact that it's located in the Botanic Gardens and is surrounded by lush greenery. Italian food with a view - sounds amazing to me.
Address: 1 Cluny Road, Singapore 259569
 
13. Steakout 
 
Source: @emperorwendy
If you're looking for quality steaks and yummy cocktails at uneatable prices then look no further than Steakout. The location is perfect for anybody in the town and Bugis area and is even more ideal for SMU students looking for a new food option. 
Address: #01-01 89 Victoria Street, Singapore 188017
 
14. Third and Sixth
 
Source: @jonathonloong
EVERYBODY loves Burgers, but things get even more exciting when restaurants try to shake things up and make their burgers unique (and from scratch). Third and Sixth does just that, with one of a kind burgers on the menu. I'm talking Kimchi on a burger kind of unique. 
Want other burger options, check out our guide to 15 incredible burgers in Singapore. 
Address: 36 Seah Street, Singapore 188392
 
15. Torte 
 
Source: @danjbangs
Torte aims to make sure you each dining experience with them is unique so Executive Chef Jason Ong is always hard at work coming up with fresh new creations. Their signature (and completely divine) chocolate torte is always on the menu and is a must try. 
You're more than welcome to bring your furry friends here too as Torte prides themselves on being canine friendly. 
Address: 96 Waterloo Street, Singapore 187967
 
16. One Place Western Bistro and Bar 
 
Source: One Place Western Bistro & Bar
If you need a place to chill with your buddies after work, I'd suggest One Place. Things to expect here are; great service, great food, relaxed atmosphere and good vibes all around. Sounds like the perfect place to unwind.
Address: 273 Jalan Kayu, Singapore 7995
 
17. Fatboys the Burger Bar 
 
Source: Fatboys
Fatboys is my go to burger place. I know when I come here I'm going to get amazing burgers, great service and a wonderful time. Its a foolproof combination of things that keep people like me constantly coming back for more. 
Address: 465 Joo Chiat Road, Singapore 427677
 
18. Nassim Hill Bakery, Bistro & Bar 
 
Source: Nassim Hill Bakery, Bistro and Bar
This place is everything you could possibly hope for rolled into one. Bakery by dawn, bistro by day and bar by night. You could come here 3 times a day and continue to be spoilt for choice. Who doesn't love variety?
Address: 56 Tanglin Road, Tanglin Post Office #01-03, Singapore 247964
 
All about the food!
 
Service is nice in a restaurant, but I'd rather skimp on service and enjoy the great food instead. That's not to say these places don't have great service, as many of them do - but fortunately for the overworked and underpaid among us, they don't charge for it.  
Know of any more restaurants that don't charge tax? Let us know in the comments section below!

In order for that to never ever happen again, here's a list of 18 Singapore restaurants that do not charge GST or Service tax!
 
1. Pepperoni Pizzeria
 
Source: @biteclubsg
To me, the only thing better than pizza is a huge pizza. I'm talking about a XXL 21 inch pizza. Add to that no service charge or GST, and you've got a fool-proof restaurant idea for friends, family and anyone in between. The TSL crew hangs out a lot here because it is so near our office, and one $50 NETT pizza can be easily shared between 5 people.
Address: 56 Zion Road, Singapore 247781 | 6 Greenwood Avenue, Hillcrest Park, Singapore 289195
 
2. Nam Nam Noodle Bar

Vietnamese food is not only incredibly tasty, the ingredients used are also really light. If you're in town and looking for affordable, healthy food, head to Nam Nam. They even have an awesome set lunch menu!
Address: 252 North Bridge Road, Singapore 179103
 
3. La Petite Cuisine

Yup, this just in - French food no longer has to cost a fortune. This restaurant aims to serve no-frills French fare at a super affordable price. This restaurant was also featured in our list of 18 Most Delicious Restaurants Under 15 Dollars.
Address: 10 Jalan Serene, Serene Centre #01-05, Singapore 258748
 
4. The ART

ART stands for the Assumption Restaurant for Training, where they provide a working environment for the aspiring future chefs among the students of the Assumption Pathway School (APS). Eating here means great food at affordable prices! 
Address: 30 Cashew Road, Singapore 679697
 
5. Food For Thought

Embrace your inner hippie as you head into Food For Thought. As their name suggests, they're all about good food for a good cause. Currently, their causes include providing clean water and ending poverty.
Address: 1 Cluny Road, Tanglin Gate #B1-00, Singapore 259569
 
6. OKB
 
Source: OKB
 
OKB stands for 2 things. 1. One Kampung Bahru (the address of this joint) and 2. Our Kind of Bar, Bistro, Bakery. Having received rave reviews for its baked goods, this place is now being thrust into the limelight again for their other dishes. Expect European food with an Asian twist. 
Address: 1 Kampung Bahru Road, Singapore 169339
 
7. Rice & Fries

For those living in the East, this place is a must try. For those who think the only thing in the East is Changi Airport, give this place a shot, and then we'll talk. This restaurant dishes up simple fare in an unpretentious environment, so the food here takes centre stage. 
Address: 484 Changi Road, Singapore 419896
 
8. Jag's Gastropub

Not only does this place serve your usual pub grub, they also serve an array of entrees to accompany your beer. It's a great place to unwind and chill after a tiring work day with your buddies.
Address: 922 East Coast Road, Singapore 459114
 
9. The French Ladle
 
 Source: The French Ladle
This is another place serving affordable French fare. This place is intimate and super homey so it's a wonderful place to head to with your main squeeze for some awesome food - and you won't have to worry about your heart breaking when you see the bill.
Address: 2 Pandan Valley, Singapore 597626
 
10. SPRMRKT
 
Source: @chrissiekoh
This place spices up your supermarket experience by providing food, retail and art. That's right, artists are allowed to showcase their work here for public enjoyment, as well as for sale. You can also visit if you're looking out for for new items to jazz up your work or living space.
Address: 2 McCallum Street, Singapore 069043
 
11. The Sushi Bar
 
Source: @waanping
This list would be incomplete without at least one Japanese place and this one takes the cake. The sushi here not only tastes amazing but is super affordable as well. It's a great place to dine with friends. The only downside is the queues can get pretty darn long.
Address: 14 Scotts Road, Far East Plaza #03-89, Singapore 228213
 
12. Casa Verde
 
Source: Eat, Shop, Blog
Case Verde actually means ""green house"" in Italian. No, you won't be dining in an actual greenhouse. The name comes from the fact that it's located in the Botanic Gardens and is surrounded by lush greenery. Italian food with a view - sounds amazing to me.
Address: 1 Cluny Road, Singapore 259569
 
13. Steakout 
 
Source: @emperorwendy
If you're looking for quality steaks and yummy cocktails at uneatable prices then look no further than Steakout. The location is perfect for anybody in the town and Bugis area and is even more ideal for SMU students looking for a new food option. 
Address: #01-01 89 Victoria Street, Singapore 188017
 
14. Third and Sixth
 
Source: @jonathonloong
EVERYBODY loves Burgers, but things get even more exciting when restaurants try to shake things up and make their burgers unique (and from scratch). Third and Sixth does just that, with one of a kind burgers on the menu. I'm talking Kimchi on a burger kind of unique. 
Want other burger options, check out our guide to 15 incredible burgers in Singapore. 
Address: 36 Seah Street, Singapore 188392
 
15. Torte 
 
Source: @danjbangs
Torte aims to make sure you each dining experience with them is unique so Executive Chef Jason Ong is always hard at work coming up with fresh new creations. Their signature (and completely divine) chocolate torte is always on the menu and is a must try. 
You're more than welcome to bring your furry friends here too as Torte prides themselves on being canine friendly. 
Address: 96 Waterloo Street, Singapore 187967
 
16. One Place Western Bistro and Bar 
 
Source: One Place Western Bistro & Bar
If you need a place to chill with your buddies after work, I'd suggest One Place. Things to expect here are; great service, great food, relaxed atmosphere and good vibes all around. Sounds like the perfect place to unwind.
Address: 273 Jalan Kayu, Singapore 7995
 
17. Fatboys the Burger Bar 
 
Source: Fatboys
Fatboys is my go to burger place. I know when I come here I'm going to get amazing burgers, great service and a wonderful time. Its a foolproof combination of things that keep people like me constantly coming back for more. 
Address: 465 Joo Chiat Road, Singapore 427677
 
18. Nassim Hill Bakery, Bistro & Bar 
 
Source: Nassim Hill Bakery, Bistro and Bar
This place is everything you could possibly hope for rolled into one. Bakery by dawn, bistro by day and bar by night. You could come here 3 times a day and continue to be spoilt for choice. Who doesn't love variety?
Address: 56 Tanglin Road, Tanglin Post Office #01-03, Singapore 247964
 
All about the food!
 
Service is nice in a restaurant, but I'd rather skimp on service and enjoy the great food instead. That's not to say these places don't have great service, as many of them do - but fortunately for the overworked and underpaid among us, they don't charge for it.  
Know of any more restaurants that don't charge tax? Let us know in the comments section below!

The Best Non-GST Restaurants in Singapore
 
You know that tiny script at the end of the menu that sneakily declares ""Prices subject to GST and service tax."" I don't know about you, but when I'm blinded by hunger I tend to miss it. And then when my bill arrives and I notice the additional costs, I die a little bit inside.
In order for that to never ever happen again, here's a list of 18 Singapore restaurants that do not charge GST or Service tax!
 
1. Pepperoni Pizzeria
 
Source: @biteclubsg
To me, the only thing better than pizza is a huge pizza. I'm talking about a XXL 21 inch pizza. Add to that no service charge or GST, and you've got a fool-proof restaurant idea for friends, family and anyone in between. The TSL crew hangs out a lot here because it is so near our office, and one $50 NETT pizza can be easily shared between 5 people.
Address: 56 Zion Road, Singapore 247781 | 6 Greenwood Avenue, Hillcrest Park, Singapore 289195
 
2. Nam Nam Noodle Bar
 
Source: @namnamnoodlebar
Vietnamese food is not only incredibly tasty, the ingredients used are also really light. If you're in town and looking for affordable, healthy food, head to Nam Nam. They even have an awesome set lunch menu!
Address: 252 North Bridge Road, Singapore 179103
 
3. La Petite Cuisine

Yup, this just in - French food no longer has to cost a fortune. This restaurant aims to serve no-frills French fare at a super affordable price. This restaurant was also featured in our list of 18 Most Delicious Restaurants Under 15 Dollars.
Address: 10 Jalan Serene, Serene Centre #01-05, Singapore 258748
 
4. The ART
 
 Source: The ART
ART stands for the Assumption Restaurant for Training, where they provide a working environment for the aspiring future chefs among the students of the Assumption Pathway School (APS). Eating here means great food at affordable prices! 
Address: 30 Cashew Road, Singapore 679697
 
5. Food For Thought
 
Source: @georgianalee
Embrace your inner hippie as you head into Food For Thought. As their name suggests, they're all about good food for a good cause. Currently, their causes include providing clean water and ending poverty.
Address: 1 Cluny Road, Tanglin Gate #B1-00, Singapore 259569
 
6. OKB
 
Source: OKB
 
OKB stands for 2 things. 1. One Kampung Bahru (the address of this joint) and 2. Our Kind of Bar, Bistro, Bakery. Having received rave reviews for its baked goods, this place is now being thrust into the limelight again for their other dishes. Expect European food with an Asian twist. 
Address: 1 Kampung Bahru Road, Singapore 169339
 
7. Rice & Fries

For those living in the East, this place is a must try. For those who think the only thing in the East is Changi Airport, give this place a shot, and then we'll talk. This restaurant dishes up simple fare in an unpretentious environment, so the food here takes centre stage. 
Address: 484 Changi Road, Singapore 419896
 
8. Jag's Gastropub

Not only does this place serve your usual pub grub, they also serve an array of entrees to accompany your beer. It's a great place to unwind and chill after a tiring work day with your buddies.
Address: 922 East Coast Road, Singapore 459114
 
9. The French Ladle
 
 Source: The French Ladle
This is another place serving affordable French fare. This place is intimate and super homey so it's a wonderful place to head to with your main squeeze for some awesome food - and you won't have to worry about your heart breaking when you see the bill.
Address: 2 Pandan Valley, Singapore 597626
 
10. SPRMRKT
 
Source: @chrissiekoh
This place spices up your supermarket experience by providing food, retail and art. That's right, artists are allowed to showcase their work here for public enjoyment, as well as for sale. You can also visit if you're looking out for for new items to jazz up your work or living space.
Address: 2 McCallum Street, Singapore 069043
 
11. The Sushi Bar
 
Source: @waanping
This list would be incomplete without at least one Japanese place and this one takes the cake. The sushi here not only tastes amazing but is super affordable as well. It's a great place to dine with friends. The only downside is the queues can get pretty darn long.

12. Casa Verde

Case Verde actually means ""green house"" in Italian. No, you won't be dining in an actual greenhouse. The name comes from the fact that it's located in the Botanic Gardens and is surrounded by lush greenery. Italian food with a view - sounds amazing to me.

13. Steakout

If you're looking for quality steaks and yummy cocktails at uneatable prices then look no further than Steakout. The location is perfect for anybody in the town and Bugis area and is even more ideal for SMU students looking for a new food option.

14. Third and Sixth
 
Source: @jonathonloong
EVERYBODY loves Burgers, but things get even more exciting when restaurants try to shake things up and make their burgers unique (and from scratch). Third and Sixth does just that, with one of a kind burgers on the menu. I'm talking Kimchi on a burger kind of unique. 
Want other burger options, check out our guide to 15 incredible burgers in Singapore.

15. Torte

Torte aims to make sure you each dining experience with them is unique so Executive Chef Jason Ong is always hard at work coming up with fresh new creations. Their signature (and completely divine) chocolate torte is always on the menu and is a must try. 
You're more than welcome to bring your furry friends here too as Torte prides themselves on being canine friendly. 
Address: 96 Waterloo Street, Singapore 187967
 
16. One Place Western Bistro and Bar

If you need a place to chill with your buddies after work, I'd suggest One Place. Things to expect here are; great service, great food, relaxed atmosphere and good vibes all around. Sounds like the perfect place to unwind.
Address: 273 Jalan Kayu, Singapore 7995
 
17. Fatboys the Burger Bar

Fatboys is my go to burger place. I know when I come here I'm going to get amazing burgers, great service and a wonderful time. Its a foolproof combination of things that keep people like me constantly coming back for more.

18. Nassim Hill Bakery, Bistro & Bar 
 
Source: Nassim Hill Bakery, Bistro and Bar
This place is everything you could possibly hope for rolled into one. Bakery by dawn, bistro by day and bar by night. You could come here 3 times a day and continue to be spoilt for choice. Who doesn't love variety?
Address: 56 Tanglin Road, Tanglin Post Office #01-03, Singapore 247964
 
All about the food!
 
Service is nice in a restaurant, but I'd rather skimp on service and enjoy the great food instead. That's not to say these places don't have great service, as many of them do - but fortunately for the overworked and underpaid among us, they don't charge for it.  
Know of any more restaurants that don't charge tax? Let us know in the comments section below!

The Best Non-GST Restaurants in Singapore
 
You know that tiny script at the end of the menu that sneakily declares ""Prices subject to GST and service tax."" I don't know about you, but when I'm blinded by hunger I tend to miss it. And then when my bill arrives and I notice the additional costs, I die a little bit inside.
In order for that to never ever happen again, here's a list of 18 Singapore restaurants that do not charge GST or Service tax!
 
1. Pepperoni Pizzeria
 
Source: @biteclubsg
To me, the only thing better than pizza is a huge pizza. I'm talking about a XXL 21 inch pizza. Add to that no service charge or GST, and you've got a fool-proof restaurant idea for friends, family and anyone in between. The TSL crew hangs out a lot here because it is so near our office, and one $50 NETT pizza can be easily shared between 5 people.
Address: 56 Zion Road, Singapore 247781 | 6 Greenwood Avenue, Hillcrest Park, Singapore 289195
 
2. Nam Nam Noodle Bar

3. La Petite Cuisine

7. Rice & Fries

For those living in the East, this place is a must try. For those who think the only thing in the East is Changi Airport, give this place a shot, and then we'll talk. This restaurant dishes up simple fare in an unpretentious environment, so the food here takes centre stage.

All about the food!
 
Service is nice in a restaurant, but I'd rather skimp on service and enjoy the great food instead. That's not to say these places don't have great service, as many of them do - but fortunately for the overworked and underpaid among us, they don't charge for it.  
Know of any more restaurants that don't charge tax? Let us know in the comments section below!

The Best Non-GST Restaurants in Singapore
 
You know that tiny script at the end of the menu that sneakily declares ""Prices subject to GST and service tax."" I don't know about you, but when I'm blinded by hunger I tend to miss it. And then when my bill arrives and I notice the additional costs, I die a little bit inside.
In order for that to never ever happen again, here's a list of 18 Singapore restaurants that do not charge GST or Service tax!
 
1. Pepperoni Pizzeria
 
Source: @biteclubsg
To me, the only thing better than pizza is a huge pizza. I'm talking about a XXL 21 inch pizza. Add to that no service charge or GST, and you've got a fool-proof restaurant idea for friends, family and anyone in between. The TSL crew hangs out a lot here because it is so near our office, and one $50 NETT pizza can be easily shared between 5 people.
Address: 56 Zion Road, Singapore 247781 | 6 Greenwood Avenue, Hillcrest Park, Singapore 289195
 
2. Nam Nam Noodle Bar
 
Source: @namnamnoodlebar
Vietnamese food is not only incredibly tasty, the ingredients used are also really light. If you're in town and looking for affordable, healthy food, head to Nam Nam. They even have an awesome set lunch menu!
Address: 252 North Bridge Road, Singapore 179103
 
3. La Petite Cuisine
 
Source: @monkiepoo
Yup, this just in - French food no longer has to cost a fortune. This restaurant aims to serve no-frills French fare at a super affordable price. This restaurant was also featured in our list of 18 Most Delicious Restaurants Under 15 Dollars.
Address: 10 Jalan Serene, Serene Centre #01-05, Singapore 258748
 
4. The ART

ART stands for the Assumption Restaurant for Training, where they provide a working environment for the aspiring future chefs among the students of the Assumption Pathway School (APS). Eating here means great food at affordable prices!

5. Food For Thought

6. OKB

OKB stands for 2 things. 1. One Kampung Bahru (the address of this joint) and 2. Our Kind of Bar, Bistro, Bakery. Having received rave reviews for its baked goods, this place is now being thrust into the limelight again for their other dishes. Expect European food with an Asian twist.

7. Rice & Fries

For those living in the East, this place is a must try. For those who think the only thing in the East is Changi Airport, give this place a shot, and then we'll talk. This restaurant dishes up simple fare in an unpretentious environment, so the food here takes centre stage.

8. Jag's Gastropub

Know of any more restaurants that don't charge tax? Let us know in the comments section below!

The Best Non-GST Restaurants in Singapore
 
You know that tiny script at the end of the menu that sneakily declares ""Prices subject to GST and service tax."" I don't know about you, but when I'm blinded by hunger I tend to miss it. And then when my bill arrives and I notice the additional costs, I die a little bit inside.
In order for that to never ever happen again, here's a list of 18 Singapore restaurants that do not charge GST or Service tax!
 
1. Pepperoni Pizzeria
 
Source: @biteclubsg
To me, the only thing better than pizza is a huge pizza. I'm talking about a XXL 21 inch pizza. Add to that no service charge or GST, and you've got a fool-proof restaurant idea for friends, family and anyone in between. The TSL crew hangs out a lot here because it is so near our office, and one $50 NETT pizza can be easily shared between 5 people.
Address: 56 Zion Road, Singapore 247781 | 6 Greenwood Avenue, Hillcrest Park, Singapore 289195
 
2. Nam Nam Noodle Bar
 
Source: @namnamnoodlebar
Vietnamese food is not only incredibly tasty, the ingredients used are also really light. If you're in town and looking for affordable, healthy food, head to Nam Nam. They even have an awesome set lunch menu!
Address: 252 North Bridge Road, Singapore 179103
 
3. La Petite Cuisine
 
Source: @monkiepoo
Yup, this just in - French food no longer has to cost a fortune. This restaurant aims to serve no-frills French fare at a super affordable price. This restaurant was also featured in our list of 18 Most Delicious Restaurants Under 15 Dollars.
Address: 10 Jalan Serene, Serene Centre #01-05, Singapore 258748
 
4. The ART
 
 Source: The ART
ART stands for the Assumption Restaurant for Training, where they provide a working environment for the aspiring future chefs among the students of the Assumption Pathway School (APS). Eating here means great food at affordable prices! 
Address: 30 Cashew Road, Singapore 679697
 
5. Food For Thought
 
Source: @georgianalee
Embrace your inner hippie as you head into Food For Thought. As their name suggests, they're all about good food for a good cause. Currently, their causes include providing clean water and ending poverty.
Address: 1 Cluny Road, Tanglin Gate #B1-00, Singapore 259569
 
6. OKB
 
Source: OKB
 
OKB stands for 2 things. 1. One Kampung Bahru (the address of this joint) and 2. Our Kind of Bar, Bistro, Bakery. Having received rave reviews for its baked goods, this place is now being thrust into the limelight again for their other dishes. Expect European food with an Asian twist. 
Address: 1 Kampung Bahru Road, Singapore 169339
 
7. Rice & Fries
 
Source: @ricenfries
For those living in the East, this place is a must try. For those who think the only thing in the East is Changi Airport, give this place a shot, and then we'll talk. This restaurant dishes up simple fare in an unpretentious environment, so the food here takes centre stage. 
Address: 484 Changi Road, Singapore 419896
 
8. Jag's Gastropub

Not only does this place serve your usual pub grub, they also serve an array of entrees to accompany your beer. It's a great place to unwind and chill after a tiring work day with your buddies.
Address: 922 East Coast Road, Singapore 459114
 
9. The French Ladle
 
 Source: The French Ladle
This is another place serving affordable French fare. This place is intimate and super homey so it's a wonderful place to head to with your main squeeze for some awesome food - and you won't have to worry about your heart breaking when you see the bill.
Address: 2 Pandan Valley, Singapore 597626
 
10. SPRMRKT
 
Source: @chrissiekoh
This place spices up your supermarket experience by providing food, retail and art. That's right, artists are allowed to showcase their work here for public enjoyment, as well as for sale. You can also visit if you're looking out for for new items to jazz up your work or living space.
Address: 2 McCallum Street, Singapore 069043
 
11. The Sushi Bar
 
Source: @waanping
This list would be incomplete without at least one Japanese place and this one takes the cake. The sushi here not only tastes amazing but is super affordable as well. It's a great place to dine with friends. The only downside is the queues can get pretty darn long.
Address: 14 Scotts Road, Far East Plaza #03-89, Singapore 228213
 
12. Casa Verde
 
Source: Eat, Shop, Blog
Case Verde actually means ""green house"" in Italian. No, you won't be dining in an actual greenhouse. The name comes from the fact that it's located in the Botanic Gardens and is surrounded by lush greenery. Italian food with a view - sounds amazing to me.
Address: 1 Cluny Road, Singapore 259569
 
13. Steakout 
 
Source: @emperorwendy
If you're looking for quality steaks and yummy cocktails at uneatable prices then look no further than Steakout. The location is perfect for anybody in the town and Bugis area and is even more ideal for SMU students looking for a new food option. 
Address: #01-01 89 Victoria Street, Singapore 188017
 
14. Third and Sixth
 
Source: @jonathonloong
EVERYBODY loves Burgers, but things get even more exciting when restaurants try to shake things up and make their burgers unique (and from scratch). Third and Sixth does just that, with one of a kind burgers on the menu. I'm talking Kimchi on a burger kind of unique. 
Want other burger options, check out our guide to 15 incredible burgers in Singapore. 
Address: 36 Seah Street, Singapore 188392
 
15. Torte 
 
Source: @danjbangs
Torte aims to make sure you each dining experience with them is unique so Executive Chef Jason Ong is always hard at work coming up with fresh new creations. Their signature (and completely divine) chocolate torte is always on the menu and is a must try. 
You're more than welcome to bring your furry friends here too as Torte prides themselves on being canine friendly. 
Address: 96 Waterloo Street, Singapore 187967
 
16. One Place Western Bistro and Bar 
 
Source: One Place Western Bistro & Bar
If you need a place to chill with your buddies after work, I'd suggest One Place. Things to expect here are; great service, great food, relaxed atmosphere and good vibes all around. Sounds like the perfect place to unwind.

17. Fatboys the Burger Bar

All about the food!
 
Service is nice in a restaurant, but I'd rather skimp on service and enjoy the great food instead. That's not to say these places don't have great service, as many of them do - but fortunately for the overworked and underpaid among us, they don't charge for it.  
Know of any more restaurants that don't charge tax? Let us know in the comments section below!

The Best Non-GST Restaurants in Singapore
 
You know that tiny script at the end of the menu that sneakily declares ""Prices subject to GST and service tax."" I don't know about you, but when I'm blinded by hunger I tend to miss it. And then when my bill arrives and I notice the additional costs, I die a little bit inside.
In order for that to never ever happen again, here's a list of 18 Singapore restaurants that do not charge GST or Service tax!
 
1. Pepperoni Pizzeria
 
Source: @biteclubsg
To me, the only thing better than pizza is a huge pizza. I'm talking about a XXL 21 inch pizza. Add to that no service charge or GST, and you've got a fool-proof restaurant idea for friends, family and anyone in between. The TSL crew hangs out a lot here because it is so near our office, and one $50 NETT pizza can be easily shared between 5 people.

Case Verde actually means ""green house"" in Italian. No, you won't be dining in an actual greenhouse. The name comes from the fact that it's located in the Botanic Gardens and is surrounded by lush greenery. Italian food with a view - sounds amazing to me.

EVERYBODY loves Burgers, but things get even more exciting when restaurants try to shake things up and make their burgers unique (and from scratch). Third and Sixth does just that, with one of a kind burgers on the menu. I'm talking Kimchi on a burger kind of unique.

Torte aims to make sure you each dining experience with them is unique so Executive Chef Jason Ong is always hard at work coming up with fresh new creations. Their signature (and completely divine) chocolate torte is always on the menu and is a must try. 
You're more than welcome to bring your furry friends here too as Torte prides themselves on being canine friendly.

All about the food!
 
Service is nice in a restaurant, but I'd rather skimp on service and enjoy the great food instead. That's not to say these places don't have great service, as many of them do - but fortunately for the overworked and underpaid among us, they don't charge for it.  
Know of any more restaurants that don't charge tax? Let us know in the comments section below!

The Best Non-GST Restaurants in Singapore
 
You know that tiny script at the end of the menu that sneakily declares ""Prices subject to GST and service tax."" I don't know about you, but when I'm blinded by hunger I tend to miss it. And then when my bill arrives and I notice the additional costs, I die a little bit inside.
In order for that to never ever happen again, here's a list of 18 Singapore restaurants that do not charge GST or Service tax!
 
1. Pepperoni Pizzeria
 
Source: @biteclubsg
To me, the only thing better than pizza is a huge pizza. I'm talking about a XXL 21 inch pizza. Add to that no service charge or GST, and you've got a fool-proof restaurant idea for friends, family and anyone in between. The TSL crew hangs out a lot here because it is so near our office, and one $50 NETT pizza can be easily shared between 5 people.
Address: 56 Zion Road, Singapore 247781 | 6 Greenwood Avenue, Hillcrest Park, Singapore 289195
 
2. Nam Nam Noodle Bar

Vietnamese food is not only incredibly tasty, the ingredients used are also really light. If you're in town and looking for affordable, healthy food, head to Nam Nam. They even have an awesome set lunch menu!
Address: 252 North Bridge Road, Singapore 179103
 
3. La Petite Cuisine

7. Rice & Fries

For those living in the East, this place is a must try. For those who think the only thing in the East is Changi Airport, give this place a shot, and then we'll talk. This restaurant dishes up simple fare in an unpretentious environment, so the food here takes centre stage.

11. The Sushi Bar

This list would be incomplete without at least one Japanese place and this one takes the cake. The sushi here not only tastes amazing but is super affordable as well. It's a great place to dine with friends. The only downside is the queues can get pretty darn long.

12. Casa Verde
 
Source: Eat, Shop, Blog
Case Verde actually means ""green house"" in Italian. No, you won't be dining in an actual greenhouse. The name comes from the fact that it's located in the Botanic Gardens and is surrounded by lush greenery. Italian food with a view - sounds amazing to me.

13. Steakout

If you're looking for quality steaks and yummy cocktails at uneatable prices then look no further than Steakout. The location is perfect for anybody in the town and Bugis area and is even more ideal for SMU students looking for a new food option.

14. Third and Sixth

EVERYBODY loves Burgers, but things get even more exciting when restaurants try to shake things up and make their burgers unique (and from scratch). Third and Sixth does just that, with one of a kind burgers on the menu. I'm talking Kimchi on a burger kind of unique.

Torte aims to make sure you each dining experience with them is unique so Executive Chef Jason Ong is always hard at work coming up with fresh new creations. Their signature (and completely divine) chocolate torte is always on the menu and is a must try. 
You're more than welcome to bring your furry friends here too as Torte prides themselves on being canine friendly.

16. One Place Western Bistro and Bar

If you need a place to chill with your buddies after work, I'd suggest One Place. Things to expect here are; great service, great food, relaxed atmosphere and good vibes all around. Sounds like the perfect place to unwind.

17. Fatboys the Burger Bar

Fatboys is my go to burger place. I know when I come here I'm going to get amazing burgers, great service and a wonderful time. Its a foolproof combination of things that keep people like me constantly coming back for more.

18. Nassim Hill Bakery, Bistro & Bar

This place is everything you could possibly hope for rolled into one. Bakery by dawn, bistro by day and bar by night. You could come here 3 times a day and continue to be spoilt for choice. Who doesn't love variety?

All about the food!
 
Service is nice in a restaurant, but I'd rather skimp on service and enjoy the great food instead. That's not to say these places don't have great service, as many of them do - but fortunately for the overworked and underpaid among us, they don't charge for it.  
Know of any more restaurants that don't charge tax? Let us know in the comments section below!

		Snippets: The Best Buffets in Singapore | The definitive review because you shouldn’t waste your calories
		Posted on November 11, 2017  by theRantingPanda  in Snippets
	
		
		



		Singapore – One of our favourite national pastime in Singapore is to eat everywhere and anywhere. Buffets are probably one of the best mode to indulge endlessly once in awhile, with no lack of options around. Our list of the best buffets in Singapore has three main considerations – quality, variety and value for money. Here are some of what we consider the best buffets in Singapore after trying numerous over the years.
*******
Edge
The award winning Edge at Pan Pacific Singapore impressed us few years ago and it still does even today. With seven open kitchens and a wide variety of cuisines including Chinese, Malay, Indian, Singaporean, Peranakan and Japanese, this is one of the longest buffet line in Singapore which I have been to. Quality is good given the wide offerings, and is probably one of the few buffets which does local delights well. The most value for money option is the lunch buffet at S$58++ per person (except Sundays); otherwise, dinner buffet starts from S$88++ per person. [Read more here…]
Make your reservation instantly at Edge here.Where: Level 3, Pan Pacific Singapore, 7 Raffles Boulevard, Singapore 039595
Tel: +65 6826 8240
*******
Ash & Elm
Located at Intercontinental Singapore, the space at Ash & Elm is gorgeous from its white translucent ceiling where there is a good dose of natural light. The highlight of Ash & Elm is the three culinary theatres which include a charcuterie and cheese room, wood-fired oven and an open charcoal-grill kitchen. For lunch, the European restaurant runs a semi-buffet lunch from S$38++ with a choice of one main course, while a full fledged Sunday Champagne Brunch Buffet (S$138++) awaits on weekends. [Read more here…]

Where: Level 1, InterContinental Singapore, 80 Middle Road, Singapore 188966
Tel: +65 68251008
*******
Ikoi Japanese Restaurant 
Possibly the only pure Japanese buffet I have returned to over the years, Ikoi restuarant at Hotel Miramar has a strong loyal following. The lunch buffet is priced at S$38++ per person, which is quite value for money. Go straight for the handrolls and sashimi.Where: 401 Havelock Road, Singapore 169631
Tel: +65 6887 3788
*******
Mitzo
Located in Grand Park Orchard Hotel, Mitzo is all about redefining Cantonese cuisine with a modern twist, as evident from its contemporary interior design and a full-fledged cocktail bar. The Weekend Dim Sum buffet is priced at S$68++ per person, with a wide range of more than forty dishes, from its appetisers & soups, to main courses, rice & noodles, classic dim sum dishes to desserts. It is challenging to try every single item, but at least I can safely say I was largely impressed with the dishes I tried, especially for a buffet. Don’t miss the tender Mitzo Special Barbecued Pork. [Read more here…]
Make your reservation instantly at Mitzo here.
Where: Level 4, Grand Park Orchard, 270 Orchard Road, Singapore 238857
Tel: +65 6603 8855
*******
Basilico
Our favourite Italian buffet, Basilico at Regent Singapore offers a semi-dinner buffet concept at S$88++ per person with a choice of mains and a solid buffet offering of antipasti and desserts. The buffet line is not the most extensive of all, but it makes up for its good quality. If you are free on weekdays, you can enjoy the buffet at S$55-++ per person. The desserts at Basilico are definitely some of the best in Singapore for buffets.

Where: Regent Singapore, Level 2, 1 Cuscaden Rd, Singapore 249715
Tel: +65 6725 3232
*******
Triple Three
The buffet restuarant at Mandarin Orchard Singapore has a strong focus on Japanese food to complement its International selections. The sashimi, sushi and seafood spread is relatively good, though you should also save space for the roast meats and a la minute grilled meats. Dinner buffet starts from S$88++ per person, though there is a perpetual promotion where you can enjoy 50% off for every second adult when payment is made using any DBS/POSB/UOB credit or debit card. [Read more here…]

 Where: Mandarin Orchard Singapore, 333 Orchard Rd, 238867
Tel: +65 6831 6271
*******
D9 Cakery
One of the most value for money High Tea Buffet in town is at D9 Cakery located in Hilton Singapore. For S$41++ per person, you get to enjoy a buffet spread of Singapore flavours with dishes such as satay, laksa as well as dim sum selections. The highlight of any high tea is definitely the desserts and pastries, which is a solid spread of a six-meter showcase from cakes to pastries to chocolate pralines, in addition to savoury pastries like classic scones. [Read more here…]
Where: Lobby Level, Hilton Singapore, 581 Orchard Road, Singapore 238883
Tel: +65 6730 3392 
*******
Melt Cafe
It may not be a huge spread at Melt Cafe, but the restaurant at Mandarin Oriental Singapore is easily one of the better ones amongst hotel buffets. The Indian cuisine here is outstanding, and you also get a good mix of Japanese cuisine, seafood spread including Maine lobsters and live stations. Save space for desserts too, where there is a live crêpe station. Prices from S$55++ for lunch and from S$75++ for dinner. [Read more here…]
Make your reservation instantly at Melt Cafe here.Where: Mandarin Oriental Singapore, 5 Raffles Avenue, Marina Square, Singapore 039797
Tel: +65 6885 3500
*******
Yan Ting
On weekends and public holidays only, Yan Ting at The St. Regis Singapore does a Dim Sum Brunch Buffet in the ala carte style with more than sixty dishes to choose from, not limited to dim sum items. The price is probably one of the most expensive dim sum buffet in Singapore at S$108++ per person, though you are really paying for the fine dining ambience and good quality dishes. The menu is split into Dim Sum, Soup, Appetisers, Seafood, Poultry, Beef and Pork, Vegetables, Rice and Noodles, Cantonese Favourites and Desserts. Some of the luxe dishes which you can expect at this price tag is the Double-boiled Fresh Abalone Soup with Black Garlic and the Wok-baked Boston Lobster with Superior Stock. [Read more here…]

Thinking of this awesome rendang!

Private dining has changed the food scene quite drastically over the last year and we believe that this trend will continue through 2019. One of the best we had so far, at @1CattynAPinch! That is if you love Peranakan food.
[GIVEAWAY] December is a special month for us and we are going to kickstart a series of giveaways! This year also marks TheRantingPanda’s 6th year since we first started this passion project in 2012!

The first giveaway is something we would have loved to go - Dinner for 2 persons at @SGTakayama restaurant at Downtown Gallery. It will be its seasonal menu worth S$280++ per person.

Contest ends 2359hrs on 7th December 2018 and here’s the catch:
1) Follow @TheRantingPanda & @SGTakayama on Instagram and Facebook Pages;
2) Tag a person you want to have dinner with;
3) Name a dish featured on our website back in September at Takayama.

Good luck!
A simple pot of Chinese tea?

This is actually a Double-boiled Conpoy and Chrysanthemum Soup with Pearl Abalone, from the newly revamped @CrystalJadeSG Jiang Nan at VivoCity. 
It is a nice balance of double boiled Conpoy and Chrysanthemum tea flavour, really comforting on a wet and cold day.
Something is missing?

Checked out the famous prata at its new coffeeshop location (right beside Dunman Food Centre), and our first thought was what went wrong? The kosong prata wasn’t crispy at all like before.

Does anyone else feel the same? Hopefully it’s just our batch, else this is saddening.
Best affair is when you have both sashimi and sushi at one go!

We were at Mezza9 earlier and tried this Sushi Kiwami platter which features an assortment of sushi and sashimi. This is one of the new menu at the restaurant in Orchard Road, where there is heightened focus on the use of sustainable ingredients, including seafood.

On a separate note, this week has been a very busy work week and we are glad to start the weekend with this!
Sugee Cake with Brandy?

Sugee Cake is our new favourite cake flavour this year, and there’s nothing not to love about this version from @FolkloreSG judging by how quickly it was polished off our plates. So glad that it has been brought back this year as part of the Christmas menu (14-31 December) here, and one reason why we love it so much is the whiff of brandy on the cake, which is being brushed with brandy!
Thinking about this snapper!

Haven’t got over New Zealand, and we were happy to be served this NZ snapper.
It’s prepared Basque style, served with clams and prepared with white wine broth. Almost every dish is a hit for us at @OlaCocinaDelMar!
New brunch goals?

Bakmie Goreng from the relatively new Asian flavours restaurant @FatChapSG at Suntec City. This is served with prawn, squid, acar and topped with sunny side up egg. It is quite a unique weekend brunch dish and a refreshing twist to the usual cafe fares. It is also served with a sambal sauce, but be warned that it is very spicy!
Our local feast continues tonight at one of our favourite local restaurants!

Delicious Beef Brisket Semur from @FolkloreSG ala carte menu, though the restaurant will also be rolling out a series of Christmas special dishes like Vindaloo and White Debal. Stay tune!

The Indian cuisine here is outstanding, and you also get a good mix of Japanese cuisine, seafood spread including Maine lobsters and live stations. Save space for desserts too, where there is a live crêpe station. Prices from S$55++ for lunch and from S$75++ for dinner. [Read more here…]

Tel: +65 6885 3500
*******
Yan Ting
On weekends and public holidays only, Yan Ting at The St. Regis Singapore does a Dim Sum Brunch Buffet in the ala carte style with more than sixty dishes to choose from, not limited to dim sum items. The price is probably one of the most expensive dim sum buffet in Singapore at S$108++ per person, though you are really paying for the fine dining ambience and good quality dishes. The menu is split into Dim Sum, Soup, Appetisers, Seafood, Poultry, Beef and Pork, Vegetables, Rice and Noodles, Cantonese Favourites and Desserts. Some of the luxe dishes which you can expect at this price tag is the Double-boiled Fresh Abalone Soup with Black Garlic and the Wok-baked Boston Lobster with Superior Stock. [Read more here…]

Thinking of this awesome rendang!

Private dining has changed the food scene quite drastically over the last year and we believe that this trend will continue through 2019. One of the best we had so far, at @1CattynAPinch! That is if you love Peranakan food.
[GIVEAWAY] December is a special month for us and we are going to kickstart a series of giveaways! This year also marks TheRantingPanda’s 6th year since we first started this passion project in 2012!

The first giveaway is something we would have loved to go - Dinner for 2 persons at @SGTakayama restaurant at Downtown Gallery. It will be its seasonal menu worth S$280++ per person.

Contest ends 2359hrs on 7th December 2018 and here’s the catch:
1) Follow @TheRantingPanda & @SGTakayama on Instagram and Facebook Pages;
2) Tag a person you want to have dinner with;
3) Name a dish featured on our website back in September at Takayama.

Good luck!
A simple pot of Chinese tea?

This is actually a Double-boiled Conpoy and Chrysanthemum Soup with Pearl Abalone, from the newly revamped @CrystalJadeSG Jiang Nan at VivoCity. 
It is a nice balance of double boiled Conpoy and Chrysanthemum tea flavour, really comforting on a wet and cold day.
Something is missing?

Checked out the famous prata at its new coffeeshop location (right beside Dunman Food Centre), and our first thought was what went wrong? The kosong prata wasn’t crispy at all like before.

Does anyone else feel the same? Hopefully it’s just our batch, else this is saddening.
Best affair is when you have both sashimi and sushi at one go!

We were at Mezza9 earlier and tried this Sushi Kiwami platter which features an assortment of sushi and sashimi. This is one of the new menu at the restaurant in Orchard Road, where there is heightened focus on the use of sustainable ingredients, including seafood.

On a separate note, this week has been a very busy work week and we are glad to start the weekend with this!
Sugee Cake with Brandy?

Sugee Cake is our new favourite cake flavour this year, and there’s nothing not to love about this version from @FolkloreSG judging by how quickly it was polished off our plates. So glad that it has been brought back this year as part of the Christmas menu (14-31 December) here, and one reason why we love it so much is the whiff of brandy on the cake, which is being brushed with brandy!
Thinking about this snapper!

Haven’t got over New Zealand, and we were happy to be served this NZ snapper.
It’s prepared Basque style, served with clams and prepared with white wine broth. Almost every dish is a hit for us at @OlaCocinaDelMar!
New brunch goals?

Bakmie Goreng from the relatively new Asian flavours restaurant @FatChapSG at Suntec City. This is served with prawn, squid, acar and topped with sunny side up egg. It is quite a unique weekend brunch dish and a refreshing twist to the usual cafe fares. It is also served with a sambal sauce, but be warned that it is very spicy!
Our local feast continues tonight at one of our favourite local restaurants!

Delicious Beef Brisket Semur from @FolkloreSG ala carte menu, though the restaurant will also be rolling out a series of Christmas special dishes like Vindaloo and White Debal. Stay tune!

		Snippets: The Best Buffets in Singapore | The definitive review because you shouldn’t waste your calories
		Posted on November 11, 2017  by theRantingPanda  in Snippets
	
		
		



		Singapore – One of our favourite national pastime in Singapore is to eat everywhere and anywhere. Buffets are probably one of the best mode to indulge endlessly once in awhile, with no lack of options around. Our list of the best buffets in Singapore has three main considerations – quality, variety and value for money. Here are some of what we consider the best buffets in Singapore after trying numerous over the years.
*******
Edge
The award winning Edge at Pan Pacific Singapore impressed us few years ago and it still does even today. With seven open kitchens and a wide variety of cuisines including Chinese, Malay, Indian, Singaporean, Peranakan and Japanese, this is one of the longest buffet line in Singapore which I have been to. Quality is good given the wide offerings, and is probably one of the few buffets which does local delights well. The most value for money option is the lunch buffet at S$58++ per person (except Sundays); otherwise, dinner buffet starts from S$88++ per person. [Read more here…]

Tel: +65 6826 8240
*******
Ash & Elm
Located at Intercontinental Singapore, the space at Ash & Elm is gorgeous from its white translucent ceiling where there is a good dose of natural light. The highlight of Ash & Elm is the three culinary theatres which include a charcuterie and cheese room, wood-fired oven and an open charcoal-grill kitchen. For lunch, the European restaurant runs a semi-buffet lunch from S$38++ with a choice of one main course, while a full fledged Sunday Champagne Brunch Buffet (S$138++) awaits on weekends.

*******
Ikoi Japanese Restaurant 
Possibly the only pure Japanese buffet I have returned to over the years, Ikoi restuarant at Hotel Miramar has a strong loyal following. The lunch buffet is priced at S$38++ per person, which is quite value for money. Go straight for the handrolls and sashimi.Where: 401 Havelock Road, Singapore 169631
Tel: +65 6887 3788
*******
Mitzo
Located in Grand Park Orchard Hotel, Mitzo is all about redefining Cantonese cuisine with a modern twist, as evident from its contemporary interior design and a full-fledged cocktail bar. The Weekend Dim Sum buffet is priced at S$68++ per person, with a wide range of more than forty dishes, from its appetisers & soups, to main courses, rice & noodles, classic dim sum dishes to desserts. It is challenging to try every single item, but at least I can safely say I was largely impressed with the dishes I tried, especially for a buffet. Don’t miss the tender Mitzo Special Barbecued Pork.

Tel: +65 6603 8855
*******
Basilico
Our favourite Italian buffet, Basilico at Regent Singapore offers a semi-dinner buffet concept at S$88++ per person with a choice of mains and a solid buffet offering of antipasti and desserts. The buffet line is not the most extensive of all, but it makes up for its good quality. If you are free on weekdays, you can enjoy the buffet at S$55-++ per person. The desserts at Basilico are definitely some of the best in Singapore for buffets.

Tel: +65 6725 3232
*******
Triple Three
The buffet restuarant at Mandarin Orchard Singapore has a strong focus on Japanese food to complement its International selections. The sashimi, sushi and seafood spread is relatively good, though you should also save space for the roast meats and a la minute grilled meats. Dinner buffet starts from S$88++ per person, though there is a perpetual promotion where you can enjoy 50% off for every second adult when payment is made using any DBS/POSB/UOB credit or debit card.

*******
D9 Cakery
One of the most value for money High Tea Buffet in town is at D9 Cakery located in Hilton Singapore. For S$41++ per person, you get to enjoy a buffet spread of Singapore flavours with dishes such as satay, laksa as well as dim sum selections. The highlight of any high tea is definitely the desserts and pastries, which is a solid spread of a six-meter showcase from cakes to pastries to chocolate pralines, in addition to savoury pastries like classic scones. [Read more here…]
Where: Lobby Level, Hilton Singapore, 581 Orchard Road, Singapore 238883
Tel: +65 6730 3392 
*******
Melt Cafe
It may not be a huge spread at Melt Cafe, but the restaurant at Mandarin Oriental Singapore is easily one of the better ones amongst hotel buffets. The Indian cuisine here is outstanding, and you also get a good mix of Japanese cuisine, seafood spread including Maine lobsters and live stations. Save space for desserts too, where there is a live crêpe station. Prices from S$55++ for lunch and from S$75++ for dinner. [Read more here…]
Make your reservation instantly at Melt Cafe here.Where: Mandarin Oriental Singapore, 5 Raffles Avenue, Marina Square, Singapore 039797

*******
Yan Ting
On weekends and public holidays only, Yan Ting at The St. Regis Singapore does a Dim Sum Brunch Buffet in the ala carte style with more than sixty dishes to choose from, not limited to dim sum items. The price is probably one of the most expensive dim sum buffet in Singapore at S$108++ per person, though you are really paying for the fine dining ambience and good quality dishes. The menu is split into Dim Sum, Soup, Appetisers, Seafood, Poultry, Beef and Pork, Vegetables, Rice and Noodles, Cantonese Favourites and Desserts. Some of the luxe dishes which you can expect at this price tag is the Double-boiled Fresh Abalone Soup with Black Garlic and the Wok-baked Boston Lobster with Superior Stock. [Read more here…]

Thinking of this awesome rendang!

Private dining has changed the food scene quite drastically over the last year and we believe that this trend will continue through 2019. One of the best we had so far, at @1CattynAPinch! That is if you love Peranakan food.
[GIVEAWAY] December is a special month for us and we are going to kickstart a series of giveaways! This year also marks TheRantingPanda’s 6th year since we first started this passion project in 2012!

The first giveaway is something we would have loved to go - Dinner for 2 persons at @SGTakayama restaurant at Downtown Gallery. It will be its seasonal menu worth S$280++ per person.

Contest ends 2359hrs on 7th December 2018 and here’s the catch:
1) Follow @TheRantingPanda & @SGTakayama on Instagram and Facebook Pages;
2) Tag a person you want to have dinner with;
3) Name a dish featured on our website back in September at Takayama.

Good luck!
A simple pot of Chinese tea?

This is actually a Double-boiled Conpoy and Chrysanthemum Soup with Pearl Abalone, from the newly revamped @CrystalJadeSG Jiang Nan at VivoCity. 
It is a nice balance of double boiled Conpoy and Chrysanthemum tea flavour, really comforting on a wet and cold day.
Something is missing?

Checked out the famous prata at its new coffeeshop location (right beside Dunman Food Centre), and our first thought was what went wrong? The kosong prata wasn’t crispy at all like before.

Does anyone else feel the same? Hopefully it’s just our batch, else this is saddening.
Best affair is when you have both sashimi and sushi at one go!

We were at Mezza9 earlier and tried this Sushi Kiwami platter which features an assortment of sushi and sashimi. This is one of the new menu at the restaurant in Orchard Road, where there is heightened focus on the use of sustainable ingredients, including seafood.

On a separate note, this week has been a very busy work week and we are glad to start the weekend with this!
Sugee Cake with Brandy?

Sugee Cake is our new favourite cake flavour this year, and there’s nothing not to love about this version from @FolkloreSG judging by how quickly it was polished off our plates. So glad that it has been brought back this year as part of the Christmas menu (14-31 December) here, and one reason why we love it so much is the whiff of brandy on the cake, which is being brushed with brandy!
Thinking about this snapper!

Haven’t got over New Zealand, and we were happy to be served this NZ snapper.
It’s prepared Basque style, served with clams and prepared with white wine broth. Almost every dish is a hit for us at @OlaCocinaDelMar!
New brunch goals?

Bakmie Goreng from the relatively new Asian flavours restaurant @FatChapSG at Suntec City. This is served with prawn, squid, acar and topped with sunny side up egg. It is quite a unique weekend brunch dish and a refreshing twist to the usual cafe fares. It is also served with a sambal sauce, but be warned that it is very spicy!
Our local feast continues tonight at one of our favourite local restaurants!

Delicious Beef Brisket Semur from @FolkloreSG ala carte menu, though the restaurant will also be rolling out a series of Christmas special dishes like Vindaloo and White Debal. Stay tune!

So glad that it has been brought back this year as part of the Christmas menu (14-31 December) here, and one reason why we love it so much is the whiff of brandy on the cake, which is being brushed with brandy!
Thinking about this snapper!

Haven’t got over New Zealand, and we were happy to be served this NZ snapper.
It’s prepared Basque style, served with clams and prepared with white wine broth. Almost every dish is a hit for us at @OlaCocinaDelMar!
New brunch goals?

Bakmie Goreng from the relatively new Asian flavours restaurant @FatChapSG at Suntec City. This is served with prawn, squid, acar and topped with sunny side up egg. It is quite a unique weekend brunch dish and a refreshing twist to the usual cafe fares. It is also served with a sambal sauce, but be warned that it is very spicy!
Our local feast continues tonight at one of our favourite local restaurants!

Delicious Beef Brisket Semur from @FolkloreSG ala carte menu, though the restaurant will also be rolling out a series of Christmas special dishes like Vindaloo and White Debal. Stay tune!

		Snippets: The Best Buffets in Singapore | The definitive review because you shouldn’t waste your calories
		Posted on November 11, 2017  by theRantingPanda  in Snippets
	
		
		



		Singapore – One of our favourite national pastime in Singapore is to eat everywhere and anywhere. Buffets are probably one of the best mode to indulge endlessly once in awhile, with no lack of options around. Our list of the best buffets in Singapore has three main considerations – quality, variety and value for money. Here are some of what we consider the best buffets in Singapore after trying numerous over the years.
*******
Edge
The award winning Edge at Pan Pacific Singapore impressed us few years ago and it still does even today. With seven open kitchens and a wide variety of cuisines including Chinese, Malay, Indian, Singaporean, Peranakan and Japanese, this is one of the longest buffet line in Singapore which I have been to. Quality is good given the wide offerings, and is probably one of the few buffets which does local delights well. The most value for money option is the lunch buffet at S$58++ per person (except Sundays); otherwise, dinner buffet starts from S$88++ per person. [Read more here…]
Make your reservation instantly at Edge here.Where: Level 3, Pan Pacific Singapore, 7 Raffles Boulevard, Singapore 039595
Tel: +65 6826 8240
*******
Ash & Elm
Located at Intercontinental Singapore, the space at Ash & Elm is gorgeous from its white translucent ceiling where there is a good dose of natural light. The highlight of Ash & Elm is the three culinary theatres which include a charcuterie and cheese room, wood-fired oven and an open charcoal-grill kitchen. For lunch, the European restaurant runs a semi-buffet lunch from S$38++ with a choice of one main course, while a full fledged Sunday Champagne Brunch Buffet (S$138++) awaits on weekends. [Read more here…]

*******
Ikoi Japanese Restaurant 
Possibly the only pure Japanese buffet I have returned to over the years, Ikoi restuarant at Hotel Miramar has a strong loyal following. The lunch buffet is priced at S$38++ per person, which is quite value for money. Go straight for the handrolls and sashimi.Where: 401 Havelock Road, Singapore 169631
Tel: +65 6887 3788
*******
Mitzo
Located in Grand Park Orchard Hotel, Mitzo is all about redefining Cantonese cuisine with a modern twist, as evident from its contemporary interior design and a full-fledged cocktail bar. The Weekend Dim Sum buffet is priced at S$68++ per person, with a wide range of more than forty dishes, from its appetisers & soups, to main courses, rice & noodles, classic dim sum dishes to desserts. It is challenging to try every single item, but at least I can safely say I was largely impressed with the dishes I tried, especially for a buffet. Don’t miss the tender Mitzo Special Barbecued Pork.

Where: Level 4, Grand Park Orchard, 270 Orchard Road, Singapore 238857
Tel: +65 6603 8855
*******
Basilico
Our favourite Italian buffet, Basilico at Regent Singapore offers a semi-dinner buffet concept at S$88++ per person with a choice of mains and a solid buffet offering of antipasti and desserts. The buffet line is not the most extensive of all, but it makes up for its good quality. If you are free on weekdays, you can enjoy the buffet at S$55-++ per person. The desserts at Basilico are definitely some of the best in Singapore for buffets.

Where: Regent Singapore, Level 2, 1 Cuscaden Rd, Singapore 249715
Tel: +65 6725 3232
*******
Triple Three
The buffet restuarant at Mandarin Orchard Singapore has a strong focus on Japanese food to complement its International selections. The sashimi, sushi and seafood spread is relatively good, though you should also save space for the roast meats and a la minute grilled meats. Dinner buffet starts from S$88++ per person, though there is a perpetual promotion where you can enjoy 50% off for every second adult when payment is made using any DBS/POSB/UOB credit or debit card.

*******
D9 Cakery
One of the most value for money High Tea Buffet in town is at D9 Cakery located in Hilton Singapore. For S$41++ per person, you get to enjoy a buffet spread of Singapore flavours with dishes such as satay, laksa as well as dim sum selections. The highlight of any high tea is definitely the desserts and pastries, which is a solid spread of a six-meter showcase from cakes to pastries to chocolate pralines, in addition to savoury pastries like classic scones. [Read more here…]
Where: Lobby Level, Hilton Singapore, 581 Orchard Road, Singapore 238883
Tel: +65 6730 3392 
*******
Melt Cafe
It may not be a huge spread at Melt Cafe, but the restaurant at Mandarin Oriental Singapore is easily one of the better ones amongst hotel buffets. The Indian cuisine here is outstanding, and you also get a good mix of Japanese cuisine, seafood spread including Maine lobsters and live stations. Save space for desserts too, where there is a live crêpe station. Prices from S$55++ for lunch and from S$75++ for dinner. [Read more here…]
Make your reservation instantly at Melt Cafe here.Where: Mandarin Oriental Singapore, 5 Raffles Avenue, Marina Square, Singapore 039797

*******
Yan Ting
On weekends and public holidays only, Yan Ting at The St. Regis Singapore does a Dim Sum Brunch Buffet in the ala carte style with more than sixty dishes to choose from, not limited to dim sum items. The price is probably one of the most expensive dim sum buffet in Singapore at S$108++ per person, though you are really paying for the fine dining ambience and good quality dishes. The menu is split into Dim Sum, Soup, Appetisers, Seafood, Poultry, Beef and Pork, Vegetables, Rice and Noodles, Cantonese Favourites and Desserts. Some of the luxe dishes which you can expect at this price tag is the Double-boiled Fresh Abalone Soup with Black Garlic and the Wok-baked Boston Lobster with Superior Stock. [Read more here…]

Yan Ting
On weekends and public holidays only, Yan Ting at The St. Regis Singapore does a Dim Sum Brunch Buffet in the ala carte style with more than sixty dishes to choose from, not limited to dim sum items.

The award winning Edge at Pan Pacific Singapore impressed us few years ago and it still does even today. With seven open kitchens and a wide variety of cuisines including Chinese, Malay, Indian, Singaporean, Peranakan and Japanese, this is one of the longest buffet line in Singapore which I have been to. Quality is good given the wide offerings, and is probably one of the few buffets which does local delights well. The most value for money option is the lunch buffet at S$58++ per person (except Sundays); otherwise, dinner buffet starts from S$88++ per person. [Read more here…]",2,

Thinking of this awesome rendang!

Private dining has changed the food scene quite drastically over the last year and we believe that this trend will continue through 2019. One of the best we had so far, at @1CattynAPinch! That is if you love Peranakan food.
[GIVEAWAY] December is a special month for us and we are going to kickstart a series of giveaways! This year also marks TheRantingPanda’s 6th year since we first started this passion project in 2012!

The first giveaway is something we would have loved to go - Dinner for 2 persons at @SGTakayama restaurant at Downtown Gallery. It will be its seasonal menu worth S$280++ per person.

Contest ends 2359hrs on 7th December 2018 and here’s the catch:
1) Follow @TheRantingPanda & @SGTakayama on Instagram and Facebook Pages;
2) Tag a person you want to have dinner with;
3) Name a dish featured on our website back in September at Takayama.

Good luck!
A simple pot of Chinese tea?

This is actually a Double-boiled Conpoy and Chrysanthemum Soup with Pearl Abalone, from the newly revamped @CrystalJadeSG Jiang Nan at VivoCity. 
It is a nice balance of double boiled Conpoy and Chrysanthemum tea flavour, really comforting on a wet and cold day.
Something is missing?

Checked out the famous prata at its new coffeeshop location (right beside Dunman Food Centre), and our first thought was what went wrong? The kosong prata wasn’t crispy at all like before.

Does anyone else feel the same? Hopefully it’s just our batch, else this is saddening.
Best affair is when you have both sashimi and sushi at one go!

We were at Mezza9 earlier and tried this Sushi Kiwami platter which features an assortment of sushi and sashimi. This is one of the new menu at the restaurant in Orchard Road, where there is heightened focus on the use of sustainable ingredients, including seafood.

On a separate note, this week has been a very busy work week and we are glad to start the weekend with this!
Sugee Cake with Brandy?

Sugee Cake is our new favourite cake flavour this year, and there’s nothing not to love about this version from @FolkloreSG judging by how quickly it was polished off our plates. So glad that it has been brought back this year as part of the Christmas menu (14-31 December) here, and one reason why we love it so much is the whiff of brandy on the cake, which is being brushed with brandy!
Thinking about this snapper!

Haven’t got over New Zealand, and we were happy to be served this NZ snapper.
It’s prepared Basque style, served with clams and prepared with white wine broth. Almost every dish is a hit for us at @OlaCocinaDelMar!
New brunch goals?

Bakmie Goreng from the relatively new Asian flavours restaurant @FatChapSG at Suntec City. This is served with prawn, squid, acar and topped with sunny side up egg. It is quite a unique weekend brunch dish and a refreshing twist to the usual cafe fares. It is also served with a sambal sauce, but be warned that it is very spicy!
Our local feast continues tonight at one of our favourite local restaurants!

Delicious Beef Brisket Semur from @FolkloreSG ala carte menu, though the restaurant will also be rolling out a series of Christmas special dishes like Vindaloo and White Debal. Stay tune!

Thinking of this awesome rendang!

Private dining has changed the food scene quite drastically over the last year and we believe that this trend will continue through 2019. One of the best we had so far, at @1CattynAPinch! That is if you love Peranakan food.
[GIVEAWAY] December is a special month for us and we are going to kickstart a series of giveaways! This year also marks TheRantingPanda’s 6th year since we first started this passion project in 2012!

The first giveaway is something we would have loved to go - Dinner for 2 persons at @SGTakayama restaurant at Downtown Gallery. It will be its seasonal menu worth S$280++ per person.

Contest ends 2359hrs on 7th December 2018 and here’s the catch:
1) Follow @TheRantingPanda & @SGTakayama on Instagram and Facebook Pages;
2) Tag a person you want to have dinner with;
3) Name a dish featured on our website back in September at Takayama.

Good luck!
A simple pot of Chinese tea?

This is actually a Double-boiled Conpoy and Chrysanthemum Soup with Pearl Abalone, from the newly revamped @CrystalJadeSG Jiang Nan at VivoCity. 
It is a nice balance of double boiled Conpoy and Chrysanthemum tea flavour, really comforting on a wet and cold day.
Something is missing?

Checked out the famous prata at its new coffeeshop location (right beside Dunman Food Centre), and our first thought was what went wrong? The kosong prata wasn’t crispy at all like before.

Does anyone else feel the same? Hopefully it’s just our batch, else this is saddening.
Best affair is when you have both sashimi and sushi at one go!

We were at Mezza9 earlier and tried this Sushi Kiwami platter which features an assortment of sushi and sashimi. This is one of the new menu at the restaurant in Orchard Road, where there is heightened focus on the use of sustainable ingredients, including seafood.

On a separate note, this week has been a very busy work week and we are glad to start the weekend with this!
Sugee Cake with Brandy?

Sugee Cake is our new favourite cake flavour this year, and there’s nothing not to love about this version from @FolkloreSG judging by how quickly it was polished off our plates. So glad that it has been brought back this year as part of the Christmas menu (14-31 December) here, and one reason why we love it so much is the whiff of brandy on the cake, which is being brushed with brandy!
Thinking about this snapper!

Haven’t got over New Zealand, and we were happy to be served this NZ snapper.
It’s prepared Basque style, served with clams and prepared with white wine broth. Almost every dish is a hit for us at @OlaCocinaDelMar!
New brunch goals?

Bakmie Goreng from the relatively new Asian flavours restaurant @FatChapSG at Suntec City. This is served with prawn, squid, acar and topped with sunny side up egg. It is quite a unique weekend brunch dish and a refreshing twist to the usual cafe fares. It is also served with a sambal sauce, but be warned that it is very spicy!
Our local feast continues tonight at one of our favourite local restaurants!

Delicious Beef Brisket Semur from @FolkloreSG ala carte menu, though the restaurant will also be rolling out a series of Christmas special dishes like Vindaloo and White Debal. Stay tune!

It is the perfect thing that motivates us to get our lazybums out of bed as early as 8am. We truly believe that a good/bad breakfast will define your mood for the day. Here’s a list of breakfast spots in the East that will make you reconsider waking up early. Enjoy!   Mr and Mrs Mohgan’s Super Crispy Roti Prata Good, artisanal pratas are hard to come by. Meet Mr and Mrs Mohgan, the couple who does super crispy roti prata in the middle of Joo Chiat. Mr Mohgan has been making prata for more than 30 years. He makes his own dough, cooked the curry and flips the prata all by himself. What’s the best way to find out if the prata is good? Eat the kosong (plain) one! I ordered a stack for my foreigner friends to try and they were full of complements. Moderately thick and pan fried till a beautiful brown, the pratas here are fresh and SUPER CRISPY. Very satisfying breakfast!Mr and Mrs Mohgan's Super Crispy Roti PrataAddress: 300-302 Joo Chiat Road, Singapore 429356Mobile: 9794 3124   Opening Hours: 6:30am to 1:30pm, closed on Tues/Wed 3rd week of the monthChin Mee Chin Confectionery Having spent quite a little while abroad, I’ve come to realize how lucky Singaporeans are to be able to enjoy our “kopi-o” with traditional kaya toast at old school coffee shops. It’s impossible to look for such comfort food within a nostalgic setting that’s affordably priced in Western countries. East-siders will be familiar with Chin Mee Chin Confectionery. Their kaya toast comes in buns rather than bread slices. These buns are made in-house and toasted till slightly charred. Generous slabs of kaya is then, spread on the buns, followed by a little chunk of butter. Imagine watching butter melting on the skillet before you cook and the aroma that lingers in the air. That’s the little action taking place on your warm toasted buns. Besides their popular kaya buns, Chin Mee Chin Confectionery is also famous for their custard cream puffs and egg tarts too!Chin Mee Chin ConfectioneryAddress: 204 E Coast Rd, Singapore 428903Opening Hours: Tue–Sun 8am to 4.30pm, Closed on MondaysYong He Bak Chor Seafood NoodlesUsed to be at Yishun, Yong He Bak Chor Seafood Noodles have relocated to Bedok a few months ago. He is actually the uncle of Ah Guan Noodles and brother of Ah Lam’s Abalone Noodles! So the whole family has been targeting seafood noodle! For $4.50 a bowl, you get a bowl of noodles tossed in homemade chilli sauce, and served with fresh prawn, clams and well braised mushroom sauce. The noodles were splendidly cooked, it’s springy, tasty, aromatic and of course, well larded. The braised mushroom slices gave the Mee Pok another delectable dimension, with its sweet and deep flavour from the prawns and clams.

She hired a talented Indonesian cook from Tanjung Pinang to whip up a good spread of dishes. They do breakfast items in the morning. Mee Rebus ($2.50) – a simple dish of thick yellow noodles with taupok, green chilli and a hard-boiled egg drenched in a flavourful spicy-sour gravy. The gravy is not overpoweringly starchy. The star for us was the Mee Soto ($2.50). The soup has many layers of flavours and a perfect balance of spices – not one outshines the others. It is strong, rich and robust, unlike the many versions out there that are weak and lack depth of flavour. Forget about the Mee Siam.

Using yellow tail fish (蕃薯鱼), they beats them into fish paste for an hour before making it into fishballs and fish cakes. That is why their fishballs are so fresh and bouncy! The mee pok is very springy and well-tossed with their homemade chilli sauce, vinegar and lard.Ru Ji KitchenAddress: Old Airport Road Food Centre #01-37, 51 Old Airport Road, Singapore 390051Opening Hours: Tue-Sun 7.30am to 1pm.

He picked up his skills at a local kaya toast chain when he was 17 years old. After working there for three years, he opened his own stall in Old Airport Road Food Centre in 2007, serving kaya toast paired with home-brewed traditional coffee, which he learnt from his father. Aside from the signature items, he serves blended ice coffee to cater to his young customers and freshly made sandwiches using traditional kaya toast bread.

The owner is formerly working as an assistant with Twa Hua when he was a young boy. At first glance, the mee pok looked a tad dry. But once the noodle and sauce were tossed up, they came together nicely. The noodles sits in a small pool of vinegar-based sauce and which is slurping good. Especially the vinegar, very fragrant and seems like it’s a superior brand. Topping the al-dente noodles are a mixture of minced pork, liver, pork balls, fried sole fish, etc. You get a bowl of soup on the side as well.

Well, good things are worth the wait right?! Queuing must be one of Singaporeans’ favourite pastimes. Standing in the queue with groups of aunties and teenagers chatting at the top of their voices made me feel as though I’m in a mini wet market.Xing Yun’s kway chap are braised to perfection. The translucent kway is slippery smooth and does not break easily in the sweet and aromatic broth. The braised pork belly, pig’s intestines and tau pok are well-flavoured. We enjoyed the braising sauce’s good consistency as it is not too thick nor too watery. The ingredients are stewed long enough for the spices to penetrate into them. Many people are skeptical when it comes to pig intestines due to an odour but fret not as Xing Yun’s intestines are tender and absorb the braising sauce so well that the odour is gone. Adventurous foodies can attempt to try pig’s tongue while big-eaters should definitely go for the pig trotters! Dip the morsels into a tangy spicy chilli sauce for that extra kick!Xing Yun Kway ChapAddress: Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, #01-14, 137 Tampines Street 11, Singapore 521137Opening Hours: Fri-Sun 8am to 1pm.Chai Chee Fried Carrot CakeWhen every other stall’s deep fried carrot cake is square, Chai Chee’s version is long and freshly deep fried. Each carrot cake stick is crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside. It is one of my favourite breakfast snack whenever I am in Bedok. Best paired with Rui Xing Ka Fei Cha Shi stall located at #01-42.Chai Chee Fried Carrot CakeAddress: Blk 216 Bedok North St 1 Market and Food Centre #01-55, Singapore 460216Yummy Sarawak Kolo Mee Being the top foodie pick in Sarawak, of course Singapore’s version cannot be compared to those served in Sarawak. Our version is different but decent. Don’t confuse this dish with wanton mee! Kolo noodles are cooked, drained and dry-tossed with different sauces, hence the name “kolo”. Usually, the must-have ingredients are springy and oily noodles, minced pork, char siew and vegetables. Sometimes, wantons are added.Related PostTaste Good - Fall Deeper in Love with Salted Egg Yolk Here!Yummy Sarawak’s Kolo Mee doesn’t consist of minced meat but its curly kolo mee is good! These noodles are only made of egg whites, hence lighter in shade and don’t contain alkali. I can’t help but salivate when the cook tossed the noodles together with the sauces. I guess the fragrance makes the stomachs of everyone who are still in the queue growl with hunger. Huge wantons with crunchy water chestnuts complement the noodles so don’t miss out on these! We also had the Chicken Feet Spare Ribs Noodles which was well-braised and flavourful.Yummy Sarawak Kolo MeeAddress: Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, #01-45, 137 Tampines Street 11, Singapore 521137Mobile: 9885 5513Opening Hours: 5am to 3pm daily.Bedok Chwee KuehOne of the cheapest chwee kueh in Singapore, Bedok Chwee Kueh is a popular breakfast for residents in the East. They are pretty generous with their radish and not very salty.

Like the other BCM in Bedok 85, Tian Nan Xing has minced pork and pork balls in the noodle soup ($3). But if you add extra $1, you will get their homemade dumplings. The springy noodles with tasty soup create wonders, the soup is sweet and makes you want to have another bowl.Tian Nan Xing Minced Pork NoodleAddress: Blk 511 Bedok North St 3, 511 Food Centre #01-10, Singapore 460511Opening Hours: 7am to 1.30pm; 5.30pm to 1.30amMizzy CornerEveryone who frequents Changi Village would know about the nasi lemak served at Mizzy’s Corner. My family and I love it for its value for money, and we would invariably leave with very satisfied tummies. The standard chicken nasi lemak set which costs $3.50, comes with a fried chicken wing, a fried egg and ikan biliss, sambal and a slice of cucumber. Unfortunately, the rice is not fragrant enough and it is too soggy. A piece of mackerel otak otak can be added for an additional $1.Mizzy CornerAddress: 2 Changi Village Road, #01-26, Singapore 500002Opening Hours: Mon-Thu 7am to 11pm. Fri, Sat & Sun 24 hours.Lek Lim Nonya Cake Confectionery Hands up for those who still eats ang ku kueh. We probably spend most of our time finding good brunch places and forgot about the old traditional kuehs we used to eat when we were young. Lek Lim Nonya Cake Confectionery is a old traditional shop in Bedok which has more than 48 years of making its own ang ku kuehs, nonya kuehs and other festivals kuehs everyday. It is pretty rare because most of the ang ku kuehs we see in shops are from factories.The Soon Kuehs and Ku Cai Kuehs here are pretty famous too. The ladies make them every afternoon and the skin is soft and slippery. When steamed, the skin was translucent and thin, packed with big fat fillings. These kuehs are sold fresh everyday over the counter and contain no preservative. This stall is actually halal certified! This malay aunty here was busy wrapping the Bulok Inti, which is a sweet blue glutinous rice with coconut shredding on top.Lek Lim Nonya Cake ConfectioneryAddress: Blk 84 Bedok North St 4 #01-21, Singapore 460084Phone: +65 64490815Opening Hours: Mon – Sat 4am-6pm; Sun 4am-2pmSong Han Carrot CakeCarrot cake here thrills my tastebuds and rivets my attention. The owner of this stall serves up a generous portion of black and white carrot cake just for the price of $3. It has a texture that is soft, light and melts in your mouth right away. The tasty chilli is fragrant and not overly spicy. The uniqueness of adding small shrimps imparts a distinct crunchiness as you enjoy each morsel of food. This stall is especially suitable for families wherein some members prefer the black version with its thick and sweet dark sauce but others go for the white one that tips towards the savoury end.Song Han Carrot CakeAddress: Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, #01-07, 137 Tampines Street 11, Singapore 521137Opening Hours: 6.30am to 1pm daily.Hua Zai HK Style Roasted DelightI have very high expectations on how roast meat from a particular stall should measure up when it comes to these Hong Kong style roast cuts. Surprisingly, Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice/Noodle was a hidden gem that I stumbled upon by chance. The roast meats are very well-prepared that it’s obvious the stallholder has the roasting temperatures right at his finger tips. The roast pork is served up warm, with skin so crispy it crackles in the mouth, lending a dainty contrast to the texture of delightfully tender meat. These roast meats are served with either noodles or rice over here and I have a particular fondness for the well-seasoned char siew. The meat is succulent with a hint of sweetness. This stall serves tasty and tender soya sauce-braised chicken too.Besides roasted meats, this coffeeshop serves delicious Muslim Food too, amongst which longtong is my favourite. I enjoy the soft and fluffy texture of the rice cakes with wisps of fragrance carried over from their banana leaf wraps. The spices used are perfectly blended into the longtong, making it taste heavenly.Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice/Noodle and Muslim FoodAddress: Tampines West Foodcourt, Blk 827, Tampines Street 81, Singapore 520827Opening Hours: Roasted Delight opens daily from 8.30am to 8.30pm while Muslim Food opens daily from 6.30am to 2pm.Glory Catering Craving for Nasi Padang-styled and Nonya-styled cuisine? Glory’s the right place to head over! Their Nonya Laksa and LongTong are crowd pleasers. The former stood out for me as it is milkier and less spicy but still rich in that uniquely Nonya flovour. It comes with generous helpings of prawns, fish cakes and lemongrass sprinkled on top that helps to rack up your appetite. The LongTong here is very smooth and go after the milk curry with its feel of graininess that comes from the pinch of dried shrimps plus grated coconut dry-fried to a golden brown. The vegetables are soft and tender but not overdone.End your meal with Nonya kuehs (bite-sized pastries) are a specialty of Glory. The kuehs here contain the right amount of sweetness, texture and delivers a burst of flavours the moment you bite into them. It’s favourable to walk in with an empty stomach so you can savour all the Nonya delights you want!Glory CateringAddress: 139 East Coast Road, Singapore 428829Phone: 6344 1749Website: http://www.glorycatering.com.sg/Opening Hours: Tue-Sun&PH 8.30am to 8.30pm. Closed on Mondays.Song Zhou Carrot CakeEven though they no longer make their own carrot cake, but after getting it from supplier, they will add some “secret” ingredients to make to make it softer. The owner will first stir fry the garlic and chai poh till fragrant, then add in some carrot cake pieces, pour over the egg batter and fry with black sweet sauce and fish sauce.Song Zhou’s black carrot cake is very very fragrant and wet. Each piece of carrot cake is so soft with aromatic charred edges. What I love about it is, they are very generous with the eggs and black sauce, hence giving it a sweet and savoury taste. The white one is also not bad, but I still preferred the black ones. And to be frank, I think the uncle does a better job than the wife. The owner said, there is no secret to frying a good plate of carrot cake. What’s most important is to control the fire so that the heat will be balanced during frying.Related PostPranakorn – Thai Eatery with No Pad Thai and Pineapple Rice!Song Zhou Carrot CakeAddress: Blk 207 Bedok North Interchange #01-18, Singapore 460207Opening Hours: Monday to Saturday 7am to 8pm, closed on SundaysHock Choon Laksa and Lor MeeIt’s hard to miss this stall when there’s always a snaking queue smacked in the middle of Eunos Market and Food Centre. I enjoy its savoury gravy that is thick but not overly starchy and full of flavours. You’re able to add your desired amount of condiments which include chopped garlic, sliced chilli, sambal chilli, chopped spring onions and vinegar. Prefer a tangier taste? Pile up on the garlic and vinegar! Served with half a braised egg with my favourite kind of creamy yolk and thin slices of pork belly well-seasoned with 5 spices, having this for breakfast starts the day on a right note! Wait, did I mention about the fried fish? This is the highlight of the Lor Mee – crispy yet moist within, it complements the dish so well.Hock Choon Laksa and Lor MeeAddress: #01-25, Eunos Market and Food Centre, Blk 4A, Eunos Crescent, Singapore 402004Opening Hours: 9am to 3pm, closed on Monday and TuesdayDong Ji Fried Kway TeowThis Char Kway Teow owner does everything single-handedly, from taking orders all the way to frying it and serving the fragrant noodles into your hands. He has a perfect rhythm while frying char kway teow, adding fresh prawns and squid into the oil before the noodles. It’s hard for your stomach not to growl while waiting in line but this is definitely worth your wait.The fluffy noodles coated with spicy, eggy goodness, gives this dish a lovely taste and texture. It has enough wok hei, the right amount of charred-ness and a spice level that was perfect. The cockles were plump and some crunchy beansprouts were scattered among the noodles. Strips of garlic chives completed the dish. Instead of your usual super black and sweet flavour, you get a more savoury finish, with just the right amount of smokiness here!Dong Ji Fried Kway TeowAddress: 51 Old Airport Road, #01-138, Old Airport Road Food Centre, Singapore 390051Opening Hours: Daily 8am to 1pm.Xin Mei Xiang Lor MeeMade from starch, eggs and some secret blend of spices, it takes about 5 hours to cook before you get the smooth and light gravy. The gravy coated the noodles very nicely and portions of braised pork belly and fish are quite generous. The modern version of lor mee contains fried fish but Xin Mei Xiang’s version still sticks to tradition and tediously hand-shred Spanish mackerel. Ain’t a fan of yellow noodles? You can opt for kway teow or bee hoon or any combination of them here! I thoroughly enjoyed the textures and mix of savoury, sweet and tangy flavours. People often say, “money can’t buy happiness” but for $4, I had a well-concocted bowl of lor mee, which I see as one of life’s simple pleasures.Xin Mei Xiang Lor MeeAddress: 51 Old Airport Road, #01-116, Old Airport Road Food Centre, Singapore 390051Mobile: 9382 2238Opening Hours: Tue&Wed, Fri-Sun 6am to 1.45pm.

The otah has a good balance of chilli and fish and exudes ethereal fragrance when served hot. The filling within contains chunks of mackerel meat and the spices packs quite a punch. What I enjoyed most was the packet of traditional nasi lemak wrapped in banana leaves that this hawker still prepares. Consisting of fried fish, an egg, ikan bilis and peanuts, it made me reminisce the days when my late grandmother would tabao this back for me on weekends for breakfast when I was young.Tan Beng Otah DelightsAddress: 51 Old Airport Road, #01-74, Old Airport Road Food Centre, Singapore 390051Opening Hours: Mon-Fri 10am to 4pm.

He makes it a point to fry only one plate at a time so be prepared to wait for your plate. A plate of char kway teow consists of a mixture of flat rice noodles and egg noodles, perfectly stir-fried with eggs, cockles, lap cheong, bean sprouts and Chinese chives.

The sauce is sweet with a slight salty aftertaste. The sour chilli cranks up the tastiness of this dish and I like it that these noodles are soggy, while not overly soft at the same time. Be warned though, the queues can get quite crazy on weekends!Jia MeiAddress: Changi Village Food Centre, #01-40, 2 Changi Village Road, Singapore 500002Opening Hours: Daily 9am to 10pm.

He makes his own dough, cooked the curry and flips the prata all by himself. What’s the best way to find out if the prata is good? Eat the kosong (plain) one!

It’s impossible to look for such comfort food within a nostalgic setting that’s affordably priced in Western countries. East-siders will be familiar with Chin Mee Chin Confectionery. Their kaya toast comes in buns rather than bread slices. These buns are made in-house and toasted till slightly charred. Generous slabs of kaya is then, spread on the buns, followed by a little chunk of butter. Imagine watching butter melting on the skillet before you cook and the aroma that lingers in the air. That’s the little action taking place on your warm toasted buns. Besides their popular kaya buns, Chin Mee Chin Confectionery is also famous for their custard cream puffs and egg tarts too!Chin Mee Chin ConfectioneryAddress: 204 E Coast Rd, Singapore 428903Opening Hours: Tue–Sun 8am to 4.30pm, Closed on MondaysYong He Bak Chor Seafood NoodlesUsed to be at Yishun, Yong He Bak Chor Seafood Noodles have relocated to Bedok a few months ago.

For $4.50 a bowl, you get a bowl of noodles tossed in homemade chilli sauce, and served with fresh prawn, clams and well braised mushroom sauce. The noodles were splendidly cooked, it’s springy, tasty, aromatic and of course, well larded. The braised mushroom slices gave the Mee Pok another delectable dimension, with its sweet and deep flavour from the prawns and clams.

Dip the morsels into a tangy spicy chilli sauce for that extra kick!Xing Yun Kway ChapAddress: Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, #01-14, 137 Tampines Street 11, Singapore 521137Opening Hours: Fri-Sun 8am to 1pm.Chai Chee Fried Carrot CakeWhen every other stall’s deep fried carrot cake is square, Chai Chee’s version is long and freshly deep fried. Each carrot cake stick is crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside. It is one of my favourite breakfast snack whenever I am in Bedok. Best paired with Rui Xing Ka Fei Cha Shi stall located at #01-42.Chai Chee Fried Carrot CakeAddress: Blk 216 Bedok North St 1 Market and Food Centre #01-55, Singapore 460216Yummy Sarawak Kolo Mee Being the top foodie pick in Sarawak, of course Singapore’s version cannot be compared to those served in Sarawak. Our version is different but decent. Don’t confuse this dish with wanton mee! Kolo noodles are cooked, drained and dry-tossed with different sauces, hence the name “kolo”. Usually, the must-have ingredients are springy and oily noodles, minced pork, char siew and vegetables. Sometimes, wantons are added.Related PostTaste Good - Fall Deeper in Love with Salted Egg Yolk Here!Yummy Sarawak’s Kolo Mee doesn’t consist of minced meat but its curly kolo mee is good! These noodles are only made of egg whites, hence lighter in shade and don’t contain alkali. I can’t help but salivate when the cook tossed the noodles together with the sauces. I guess the fragrance makes the stomachs of everyone who are still in the queue growl with hunger. Huge wantons with crunchy water chestnuts complement the noodles so don’t miss out on these! We also had the Chicken Feet Spare Ribs Noodles which was well-braised and flavourful.Yummy Sarawak Kolo MeeAddress: Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, #01-45, 137 Tampines Street 11, Singapore 521137Mobile: 9885 5513Opening Hours: 5am to 3pm daily.Bedok Chwee KuehOne of the cheapest chwee kueh in Singapore, Bedok Chwee Kueh is a popular breakfast for residents in the East. They are pretty generous with their radish and not very salty. The steamed rice cakes are soft and do pair your chwee kueh with the chilli sauce.Bedok Chwee KuehAddress: Blk 208B New Upper Changi Road, #01-53 Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre, Singapore 460208Opening Hours: 8am to 11pmTian Nan Xing Minced Pork NoodleIf you have always been eating Bedok 85 minced pork noodle soup for supper, now you can try Tian Nan Xing minced pork noodle at Blk 511 Bedok North. With more than 80 years of history, the stall is now managed by 3rd and 4th generation. They focus on using good and fresh ingredients, hence each bowl of bak chor mee is flavourful and tasty. Like the other BCM in Bedok 85, Tian Nan Xing has minced pork and pork balls in the noodle soup ($3). But if you add extra $1, you will get their homemade dumplings. The springy noodles with tasty soup create wonders, the soup is sweet and makes you want to have another bowl.Tian Nan Xing Minced Pork NoodleAddress: Blk 511 Bedok North St 3, 511 Food Centre #01-10, Singapore 460511Opening Hours: 7am to 1.30pm; 5.30pm to 1.30amMizzy CornerEveryone who frequents Changi Village would know about the nasi lemak served at Mizzy’s Corner. My family and I love it for its value for money, and we would invariably leave with very satisfied tummies. The standard chicken nasi lemak set which costs $3.50, comes with a fried chicken wing, a fried egg and ikan biliss, sambal and a slice of cucumber. Unfortunately, the rice is not fragrant enough and it is too soggy. A piece of mackerel otak otak can be added for an additional $1.Mizzy CornerAddress: 2 Changi Village Road, #01-26, Singapore 500002Opening Hours: Mon-Thu 7am to 11pm. Fri, Sat & Sun 24 hours.Lek Lim Nonya Cake Confectionery Hands up for those who still eats ang ku kueh. We probably spend most of our time finding good brunch places and forgot about the old traditional kuehs we used to eat when we were young. Lek Lim Nonya Cake Confectionery is a old traditional shop in Bedok which has more than 48 years of making its own ang ku kuehs, nonya kuehs and other festivals kuehs everyday. It is pretty rare because most of the ang ku kuehs we see in shops are from factories.The Soon Kuehs and Ku Cai Kuehs here are pretty famous too. The ladies make them every afternoon and the skin is soft and slippery. When steamed, the skin was translucent and thin, packed with big fat fillings. These kuehs are sold fresh everyday over the counter and contain no preservative. This stall is actually halal certified! This malay aunty here was busy wrapping the Bulok Inti, which is a sweet blue glutinous rice with coconut shredding on top.Lek Lim Nonya Cake ConfectioneryAddress: Blk 84 Bedok North St 4 #01-21, Singapore 460084Phone: +65 64490815Opening Hours: Mon – Sat 4am-6pm; Sun 4am-2pmSong Han Carrot CakeCarrot cake here thrills my tastebuds and rivets my attention. The owner of this stall serves up a generous portion of black and white carrot cake just for the price of $3. It has a texture that is soft, light and melts in your mouth right away. The tasty chilli is fragrant and not overly spicy. The uniqueness of adding small shrimps imparts a distinct crunchiness as you enjoy each morsel of food. This stall is especially suitable for families wherein some members prefer the black version with its thick and sweet dark sauce but others go for the white one that tips towards the savoury end.Song Han Carrot CakeAddress: Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, #01-07, 137 Tampines Street 11, Singapore 521137Opening Hours: 6.30am to 1pm daily.Hua Zai HK Style Roasted DelightI have very high expectations on how roast meat from a particular stall should measure up when it comes to these Hong Kong style roast cuts. Surprisingly, Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice/Noodle was a hidden gem that I stumbled upon by chance. The roast meats are very well-prepared that it’s obvious the stallholder has the roasting temperatures right at his finger tips. The roast pork is served up warm, with skin so crispy it crackles in the mouth, lending a dainty contrast to the texture of delightfully tender meat. These roast meats are served with either noodles or rice over here and I have a particular fondness for the well-seasoned char siew. The meat is succulent with a hint of sweetness. This stall serves tasty and tender soya sauce-braised chicken too.Besides roasted meats, this coffeeshop serves delicious Muslim Food too, amongst which longtong is my favourite. I enjoy the soft and fluffy texture of the rice cakes with wisps of fragrance carried over from their banana leaf wraps. The spices used are perfectly blended into the longtong, making it taste heavenly.Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice/Noodle and Muslim FoodAddress: Tampines West Foodcourt, Blk 827, Tampines Street 81, Singapore 520827Opening Hours: Roasted Delight opens daily from 8.30am to 8.30pm while Muslim Food opens daily from 6.30am to 2pm.Glory Catering Craving for Nasi Padang-styled and Nonya-styled cuisine? Glory’s the right place to head over! Their Nonya Laksa and LongTong are crowd pleasers. The former stood out for me as it is milkier and less spicy but still rich in that uniquely Nonya flovour. It comes with generous helpings of prawns, fish cakes and lemongrass sprinkled on top that helps to rack up your appetite. The LongTong here is very smooth and go after the milk curry with its feel of graininess that comes from the pinch of dried shrimps plus grated coconut dry-fried to a golden brown. The vegetables are soft and tender but not overdone.End your meal with Nonya kuehs (bite-sized pastries) are a specialty of Glory. The kuehs here contain the right amount of sweetness, texture and delivers a burst of flavours the moment you bite into them. It’s favourable to walk in with an empty stomach so you can savour all the Nonya delights you want!Glory CateringAddress: 139 East Coast Road, Singapore 428829Phone: 6344 1749Website: http://www.glorycatering.com.sg/Opening Hours: Tue-Sun&PH 8.30am to 8.30pm. Closed on Mondays.Song Zhou Carrot CakeEven though they no longer make their own carrot cake, but after getting it from supplier, they will add some “secret” ingredients to make to make it softer. The owner will first stir fry the garlic and chai poh till fragrant, then add in some carrot cake pieces, pour over the egg batter and fry with black sweet sauce and fish sauce.Song Zhou’s black carrot cake is very very fragrant and wet. Each piece of carrot cake is so soft with aromatic charred edges. What I love about it is, they are very generous with the eggs and black sauce, hence giving it a sweet and savoury taste. The white one is also not bad, but I still preferred the black ones. And to be frank, I think the uncle does a better job than the wife. The owner said, there is no secret to frying a good plate of carrot cake. What’s most important is to control the fire so that the heat will be balanced during frying.Related PostPranakorn – Thai Eatery with No Pad Thai and Pineapple Rice!Song Zhou Carrot CakeAddress: Blk 207 Bedok North Interchange #01-18, Singapore 460207Opening Hours: Monday to Saturday 7am to 8pm, closed on SundaysHock Choon Laksa and Lor MeeIt’s hard to miss this stall when there’s always a snaking queue smacked in the middle of Eunos Market and Food Centre. I enjoy its savoury gravy that is thick but not overly starchy and full of flavours. You’re able to add your desired amount of condiments which include chopped garlic, sliced chilli, sambal chilli, chopped spring onions and vinegar. Prefer a tangier taste? Pile up on the garlic and vinegar! Served with half a braised egg with my favourite kind of creamy yolk and thin slices of pork belly well-seasoned with 5 spices, having this for breakfast starts the day on a right note! Wait, did I mention about the fried fish? This is the highlight of the Lor Mee – crispy yet moist within, it complements the dish so well.Hock Choon Laksa and Lor MeeAddress: #01-25, Eunos Market and Food Centre, Blk 4A, Eunos Crescent, Singapore 402004Opening Hours: 9am to 3pm, closed on Monday and TuesdayDong Ji Fried Kway TeowThis Char Kway Teow owner does everything single-handedly, from taking orders all the way to frying it and serving the fragrant noodles into your hands. He has a perfect rhythm while frying char kway teow, adding fresh prawns and squid into the oil before the noodles. It’s hard for your stomach not to growl while waiting in line but this is definitely worth your wait.The fluffy noodles coated with spicy, eggy goodness, gives this dish a lovely taste and texture. It has enough wok hei, the right amount of charred-ness and a spice level that was perfect. The cockles were plump and some crunchy beansprouts were scattered among the noodles. Strips of garlic chives completed the dish. Instead of your usual super black and sweet flavour, you get a more savoury finish, with just the right amount of smokiness here!Dong Ji Fried Kway TeowAddress: 51 Old Airport Road, #01-138, Old Airport Road Food Centre, Singapore 390051Opening Hours: Daily 8am to 1pm.Xin Mei Xiang Lor MeeMade from starch, eggs and some secret blend of spices, it takes about 5 hours to cook before you get the smooth and light gravy. The gravy coated the noodles very nicely and portions of braised pork belly and fish are quite generous. The modern version of lor mee contains fried fish but Xin Mei Xiang’s version still sticks to tradition and tediously hand-shred Spanish mackerel. Ain’t a fan of yellow noodles? You can opt for kway teow or bee hoon or any combination of them here! I thoroughly enjoyed the textures and mix of savoury, sweet and tangy flavours. People often say, “money can’t buy happiness” but for $4, I had a well-concocted bowl of lor mee, which I see as one of life’s simple pleasures.Xin Mei Xiang Lor MeeAddress: 51 Old Airport Road, #01-116, Old Airport Road Food Centre, Singapore 390051Mobile: 9382 2238Opening Hours: Tue&Wed, Fri-Sun 6am to 1.45pm. Closed on Mondays and Thursdays.Tan Beng Otah DelightsOtah here is prepared on the spot and freshly wrapped. The otah has a good balance of chilli and fish and exudes ethereal fragrance when served hot. The filling within contains chunks of mackerel meat and the spices packs quite a punch. What I enjoyed most was the packet of traditional nasi lemak wrapped in banana leaves that this hawker still prepares. Consisting of fried fish, an egg, ikan bilis and peanuts, it made me reminisce the days when my late grandmother would tabao this back for me on weekends for breakfast when I was young.Tan Beng Otah DelightsAddress: 51 Old Airport Road, #01-74, Old Airport Road Food Centre, Singapore 390051Opening Hours: Mon-Fri 10am to 4pm. Sat&Sun 7am to 4pm. Closed on Wednesdays.Da Zhong Mei ShiThe elderly hawker does all the cooking and the end result – a wonderfully charred plate of kway teow that’s out to tantalize our tastebuds. He makes it a point to fry only one plate at a time so be prepared to wait for your plate. A plate of char kway teow consists of a mixture of flat rice noodles and egg noodles, perfectly stir-fried with eggs, cockles, lap cheong, bean sprouts and Chinese chives. I’m not sure which particular stall you frequent but I grew up eating from this old uncle hence, sharing my wonderful childhood experience with you.Da Zhong Mei Shi Char Kway TeowAddress: Changi Village Food Centre, #01-19, 2 Changi Village Road, Singapore 500002Opening Hours: Daily 7am to 10pm.Jia Mei Wanton MeeMany might be familiar with this hawker’s wanton noodles but I prefer their mushrooms and chicken feet noodles, soaked in their special sauce. The sauce is sweet with a slight salty aftertaste. The sour chilli cranks up the tastiness of this dish and I like it that these noodles are soggy, while not overly soft at the same time. Be warned though, the queues can get quite crazy on weekends!Jia MeiAddress: Changi Village Food Centre, #01-40, 2 Changi Village Road, Singapore 500002Opening Hours: Daily 9am to 10pm.

When tossed with my noodles and bean sprouts, it is super shiok.

It is always long queue during lunch and the only time when it does not have a queue, is Sunday. Because the stall is closed on Sunday! Go for their chicken wing, it is deep fried till crispy. Dishes include luncheon meat, fried kuning fish, fishcakes, stir fry long beans, ikan bilis, otah, fried eggs etc. Its nasi lemak is very light and fluffy because they use coconut milk sparingly. The rice is best eaten with their homemade sambal chilli sauce.Hon Ni KitchenAddress: Blk 216 Bedok North Street 1 #01-07, Singapore 460216Opening Hours: 7.30am to 2pm, closed on Sunday & MondayKim Choo Kueh ChangYou name it, they got it! Offering an abundance of rice dumplings with different stuffing, Kim Choo definitely doesn’t disappoint. The ingredients are pretty generous here and very tasty. No matter which flavour of rice dumpling you select, you’ll realize that the rice was not in any overwhelmed by the ingredients. The glutinous rice was soft but compact, with a nice aroma. Each rice grain fully absorbed the essence of the ingredients wrapped within. You get a complete package that’s so flavoursome you can’t just stop at one.Kim Choo Kueh ChangAddress: 60/62 Joo Chiat Place, Singapore 427784/85Phone: 6344 0830Opening Hours: Daily 10am to 10pm.Planning what to do or where to eat over the weekend?

It is the perfect thing that motivates us to get our lazybums out of bed as early as 8am. We truly believe that a good/bad breakfast will define your mood for the day. Here’s a list of breakfast spots in the East that will make you reconsider waking up early. Enjoy!   Mr and Mrs Mohgan’s Super Crispy Roti Prata Good, artisanal pratas are hard to come by. Meet Mr and Mrs Mohgan, the couple who does super crispy roti prata in the middle of Joo Chiat. Mr Mohgan has been making prata for more than 30 years. He makes his own dough, cooked the curry and flips the prata all by himself. What’s the best way to find out if the prata is good? Eat the kosong (plain) one! I ordered a stack for my foreigner friends to try and they were full of complements. Moderately thick and pan fried till a beautiful brown, the pratas here are fresh and SUPER CRISPY. Very satisfying breakfast!Mr and Mrs Mohgan's Super Crispy Roti PrataAddress: 300-302 Joo Chiat Road, Singapore 429356Mobile: 9794 3124   Opening Hours: 6:30am to 1:30pm, closed on Tues/Wed 3rd week of the monthChin Mee Chin Confectionery Having spent quite a little while abroad, I’ve come to realize how lucky Singaporeans are to be able to enjoy our “kopi-o” with traditional kaya toast at old school coffee shops. It’s impossible to look for such comfort food within a nostalgic setting that’s affordably priced in Western countries. East-siders will be familiar with Chin Mee Chin Confectionery. Their kaya toast comes in buns rather than bread slices. These buns are made in-house and toasted till slightly charred. Generous slabs of kaya is then, spread on the buns, followed by a little chunk of butter. Imagine watching butter melting on the skillet before you cook and the aroma that lingers in the air. That’s the little action taking place on your warm toasted buns. Besides their popular kaya buns, Chin Mee Chin Confectionery is also famous for their custard cream puffs and egg tarts too!Chin Mee Chin ConfectioneryAddress: 204 E Coast Rd, Singapore 428903Opening Hours: Tue–Sun 8am to 4.30pm, Closed on MondaysYong He Bak Chor Seafood NoodlesUsed to be at Yishun, Yong He Bak Chor Seafood Noodles have relocated to Bedok a few months ago. He is actually the uncle of Ah Guan Noodles and brother of Ah Lam’s Abalone Noodles! So the whole family has been targeting seafood noodle! For $4.50 a bowl, you get a bowl of noodles tossed in homemade chilli sauce, and served with fresh prawn, clams and well braised mushroom sauce. The noodles were splendidly cooked, it’s springy, tasty, aromatic and of course, well larded. The braised mushroom slices gave the Mee Pok another delectable dimension, with its sweet and deep flavour from the prawns and clams. The deluxe $10 version comes with either big prawns or crayfish.Yong He Bak Chor Seafood NoodlesAddress: 18 Brewcoffee, Blk 18 Bedok South Road, Singapore 460018Opening Hours: 7.30am – 3pm dailyEnak Opened last year end, owner Ibu Bida gave up her corporate job to start a hawker stall. She hired a talented Indonesian cook from Tanjung Pinang to whip up a good spread of dishes. They do breakfast items in the morning. Mee Rebus ($2.50) – a simple dish of thick yellow noodles with taupok, green chilli and a hard-boiled egg drenched in a flavourful spicy-sour gravy. The gravy is not overpoweringly starchy. The star for us was the Mee Soto ($2.50). The soup has many layers of flavours and a perfect balance of spices – not one outshines the others. It is strong, rich and robust, unlike the many versions out there that are weak and lack depth of flavour. Forget about the Mee Siam.

Using yellow tail fish (蕃薯鱼), they beats them into fish paste for an hour before making it into fishballs and fish cakes. That is why their fishballs are so fresh and bouncy! The mee pok is very springy and well-tossed with their homemade chilli sauce, vinegar and lard.Ru Ji KitchenAddress: Old Airport Road Food Centre #01-37, 51 Old Airport Road, Singapore 390051Opening Hours: Tue-Sun 7.30am to 1pm.

He picked up his skills at a local kaya toast chain when he was 17 years old. After working there for three years, he opened his own stall in Old Airport Road Food Centre in 2007, serving kaya toast paired with home-brewed traditional coffee, which he learnt from his father. Aside from the signature items, he serves blended ice coffee to cater to his young customers and freshly made sandwiches using traditional kaya toast bread. In response to the health consciousness of Singaporeans, kaya used in Mr. Soh’s stall is specially created to make it less sweet and not cloying when served with coffee or tea.Toast HutAddress: Old Airport Road Food Centre #01-52, Blk 51 Old Airport Road, Singapore 390051Opening Hours: 6:30 am to 3 pm, closed on Thursdays)Fu Yuan Minced Pork Noodle Occupying just half a stall at Tampines Street 21, Fu Yuan Teochew Bak Chor Mee is really an unassuming establishment. The owner is formerly working as an assistant with Twa Hua when he was a young boy. At first glance, the mee pok looked a tad dry. But once the noodle and sauce were tossed up, they came together nicely. The noodles sits in a small pool of vinegar-based sauce and which is slurping good. Especially the vinegar, very fragrant and seems like it’s a superior brand. Topping the al-dente noodles are a mixture of minced pork, liver, pork balls, fried sole fish, etc. You get a bowl of soup on the side as well. Read about the full review here.Fu Yuan Minced Pork NoodleAddress: 201C Tampines Street 21, Singapore 523201Opening Hours: 6am-230pm, 5pm -8pm, closed every 2 weeks on the WednesdayXing Yun Kway Chap Business is overwhelmingly good that this kway chap stall only opens from Friday to Sunday so expect long queues forming. Well, good things are worth the wait right?! Queuing must be one of Singaporeans’ favourite pastimes. Standing in the queue with groups of aunties and teenagers chatting at the top of their voices made me feel as though I’m in a mini wet market.Xing Yun’s kway chap are braised to perfection. The translucent kway is slippery smooth and does not break easily in the sweet and aromatic broth. The braised pork belly, pig’s intestines and tau pok are well-flavoured. We enjoyed the braising sauce’s good consistency as it is not too thick nor too watery. The ingredients are stewed long enough for the spices to penetrate into them. Many people are skeptical when it comes to pig intestines due to an odour but fret not as Xing Yun’s intestines are tender and absorb the braising sauce so well that the odour is gone. Adventurous foodies can attempt to try pig’s tongue while big-eaters should definitely go for the pig trotters! Dip the morsels into a tangy spicy chilli sauce for that extra kick!Xing Yun Kway ChapAddress: Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, #01-14, 137 Tampines Street 11, Singapore 521137Opening Hours: Fri-Sun 8am to 1pm.Chai Chee Fried Carrot CakeWhen every other stall’s deep fried carrot cake is square, Chai Chee’s version is long and freshly deep fried. Each carrot cake stick is crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside. It is one of my favourite breakfast snack whenever I am in Bedok. Best paired with Rui Xing Ka Fei Cha Shi stall located at #01-42.Chai Chee Fried Carrot CakeAddress: Blk 216 Bedok North St 1 Market and Food Centre #01-55, Singapore 460216Yummy Sarawak Kolo Mee Being the top foodie pick in Sarawak, of course Singapore’s version cannot be compared to those served in Sarawak. Our version is different but decent. Don’t confuse this dish with wanton mee! Kolo noodles are cooked, drained and dry-tossed with different sauces, hence the name “kolo”. Usually, the must-have ingredients are springy and oily noodles, minced pork, char siew and vegetables. Sometimes, wantons are added.Related PostTaste Good - Fall Deeper in Love with Salted Egg Yolk Here!Yummy Sarawak’s Kolo Mee doesn’t consist of minced meat but its curly kolo mee is good! These noodles are only made of egg whites, hence lighter in shade and don’t contain alkali. I can’t help but salivate when the cook tossed the noodles together with the sauces. I guess the fragrance makes the stomachs of everyone who are still in the queue growl with hunger. Huge wantons with crunchy water chestnuts complement the noodles so don’t miss out on these! We also had the Chicken Feet Spare Ribs Noodles which was well-braised and flavourful.Yummy Sarawak Kolo MeeAddress: Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, #01-45, 137 Tampines Street 11, Singapore 521137Mobile: 9885 5513Opening Hours: 5am to 3pm daily.Bedok Chwee KuehOne of the cheapest chwee kueh in Singapore, Bedok Chwee Kueh is a popular breakfast for residents in the East. They are pretty generous with their radish and not very salty. The steamed rice cakes are soft and do pair your chwee kueh with the chilli sauce.Bedok Chwee KuehAddress: Blk 208B New Upper Changi Road, #01-53 Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre, Singapore 460208Opening Hours: 8am to 11pmTian Nan Xing Minced Pork NoodleIf you have always been eating Bedok 85 minced pork noodle soup for supper, now you can try Tian Nan Xing minced pork noodle at Blk 511 Bedok North. With more than 80 years of history, the stall is now managed by 3rd and 4th generation. They focus on using good and fresh ingredients, hence each bowl of bak chor mee is flavourful and tasty. Like the other BCM in Bedok 85, Tian Nan Xing has minced pork and pork balls in the noodle soup ($3). But if you add extra $1, you will get their homemade dumplings. The springy noodles with tasty soup create wonders, the soup is sweet and makes you want to have another bowl.Tian Nan Xing Minced Pork NoodleAddress: Blk 511 Bedok North St 3, 511 Food Centre #01-10, Singapore 460511Opening Hours: 7am to 1.30pm; 5.30pm to 1.30amMizzy CornerEveryone who frequents Changi Village would know about the nasi lemak served at Mizzy’s Corner. My family and I love it for its value for money, and we would invariably leave with very satisfied tummies. The standard chicken nasi lemak set which costs $3.50, comes with a fried chicken wing, a fried egg and ikan biliss, sambal and a slice of cucumber. Unfortunately, the rice is not fragrant enough and it is too soggy. A piece of mackerel otak otak can be added for an additional $1.Mizzy CornerAddress: 2 Changi Village Road, #01-26, Singapore 500002Opening Hours: Mon-Thu 7am to 11pm. Fri, Sat & Sun 24 hours.Lek Lim Nonya Cake Confectionery Hands up for those who still eats ang ku kueh. We probably spend most of our time finding good brunch places and forgot about the old traditional kuehs we used to eat when we were young. Lek Lim Nonya Cake Confectionery is a old traditional shop in Bedok which has more than 48 years of making its own ang ku kuehs, nonya kuehs and other festivals kuehs everyday. It is pretty rare because most of the ang ku kuehs we see in shops are from factories.The Soon Kuehs and Ku Cai Kuehs here are pretty famous too. The ladies make them every afternoon and the skin is soft and slippery. When steamed, the skin was translucent and thin, packed with big fat fillings. These kuehs are sold fresh everyday over the counter and contain no preservative. This stall is actually halal certified! This malay aunty here was busy wrapping the Bulok Inti, which is a sweet blue glutinous rice with coconut shredding on top.Lek Lim Nonya Cake ConfectioneryAddress: Blk 84 Bedok North St 4 #01-21, Singapore 460084Phone: +65 64490815Opening Hours: Mon – Sat 4am-6pm; Sun 4am-2pmSong Han Carrot CakeCarrot cake here thrills my tastebuds and rivets my attention. The owner of this stall serves up a generous portion of black and white carrot cake just for the price of $3. It has a texture that is soft, light and melts in your mouth right away. The tasty chilli is fragrant and not overly spicy. The uniqueness of adding small shrimps imparts a distinct crunchiness as you enjoy each morsel of food. This stall is especially suitable for families wherein some members prefer the black version with its thick and sweet dark sauce but others go for the white one that tips towards the savoury end.Song Han Carrot CakeAddress: Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, #01-07, 137 Tampines Street 11, Singapore 521137Opening Hours: 6.30am to 1pm daily.Hua Zai HK Style Roasted DelightI have very high expectations on how roast meat from a particular stall should measure up when it comes to these Hong Kong style roast cuts. Surprisingly, Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice/Noodle was a hidden gem that I stumbled upon by chance. The roast meats are very well-prepared that it’s obvious the stallholder has the roasting temperatures right at his finger tips. The roast pork is served up warm, with skin so crispy it crackles in the mouth, lending a dainty contrast to the texture of delightfully tender meat. These roast meats are served with either noodles or rice over here and I have a particular fondness for the well-seasoned char siew. The meat is succulent with a hint of sweetness. This stall serves tasty and tender soya sauce-braised chicken too.Besides roasted meats, this coffeeshop serves delicious Muslim Food too, amongst which longtong is my favourite. I enjoy the soft and fluffy texture of the rice cakes with wisps of fragrance carried over from their banana leaf wraps. The spices used are perfectly blended into the longtong, making it taste heavenly.Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice/Noodle and Muslim FoodAddress: Tampines West Foodcourt, Blk 827, Tampines Street 81, Singapore 520827Opening Hours: Roasted Delight opens daily from 8.30am to 8.30pm while Muslim Food opens daily from 6.30am to 2pm.Glory Catering Craving for Nasi Padang-styled and Nonya-styled cuisine? Glory’s the right place to head over! Their Nonya Laksa and LongTong are crowd pleasers. The former stood out for me as it is milkier and less spicy but still rich in that uniquely Nonya flovour. It comes with generous helpings of prawns, fish cakes and lemongrass sprinkled on top that helps to rack up your appetite. The LongTong here is very smooth and go after the milk curry with its feel of graininess that comes from the pinch of dried shrimps plus grated coconut dry-fried to a golden brown. The vegetables are soft and tender but not overdone.End your meal with Nonya kuehs (bite-sized pastries) are a specialty of Glory. The kuehs here contain the right amount of sweetness, texture and delivers a burst of flavours the moment you bite into them. It’s favourable to walk in with an empty stomach so you can savour all the Nonya delights you want!Glory CateringAddress: 139 East Coast Road, Singapore 428829Phone: 6344 1749Website: http://www.glorycatering.com.sg/Opening Hours: Tue-Sun&PH 8.30am to 8.30pm. Closed on Mondays.Song Zhou Carrot CakeEven though they no longer make their own carrot cake, but after getting it from supplier, they will add some “secret” ingredients to make to make it softer. The owner will first stir fry the garlic and chai poh till fragrant, then add in some carrot cake pieces, pour over the egg batter and fry with black sweet sauce and fish sauce.Song Zhou’s black carrot cake is very very fragrant and wet. Each piece of carrot cake is so soft with aromatic charred edges. What I love about it is, they are very generous with the eggs and black sauce, hence giving it a sweet and savoury taste. The white one is also not bad, but I still preferred the black ones. And to be frank, I think the uncle does a better job than the wife. The owner said, there is no secret to frying a good plate of carrot cake. What’s most important is to control the fire so that the heat will be balanced during frying.Related PostPranakorn – Thai Eatery with No Pad Thai and Pineapple Rice!Song Zhou Carrot CakeAddress: Blk 207 Bedok North Interchange #01-18, Singapore 460207Opening Hours: Monday to Saturday 7am to 8pm, closed on SundaysHock Choon Laksa and Lor MeeIt’s hard to miss this stall when there’s always a snaking queue smacked in the middle of Eunos Market and Food Centre. I enjoy its savoury gravy that is thick but not overly starchy and full of flavours. You’re able to add your desired amount of condiments which include chopped garlic, sliced chilli, sambal chilli, chopped spring onions and vinegar. Prefer a tangier taste? Pile up on the garlic and vinegar! Served with half a braised egg with my favourite kind of creamy yolk and thin slices of pork belly well-seasoned with 5 spices, having this for breakfast starts the day on a right note! Wait, did I mention about the fried fish? This is the highlight of the Lor Mee – crispy yet moist within, it complements the dish so well.Hock Choon Laksa and Lor MeeAddress: #01-25, Eunos Market and Food Centre, Blk 4A, Eunos Crescent, Singapore 402004Opening Hours: 9am to 3pm, closed on Monday and TuesdayDong Ji Fried Kway TeowThis Char Kway Teow owner does everything single-handedly, from taking orders all the way to frying it and serving the fragrant noodles into your hands. He has a perfect rhythm while frying char kway teow, adding fresh prawns and squid into the oil before the noodles. It’s hard for your stomach not to growl while waiting in line but this is definitely worth your wait.The fluffy noodles coated with spicy, eggy goodness, gives this dish a lovely taste and texture. It has enough wok hei, the right amount of charred-ness and a spice level that was perfect. The cockles were plump and some crunchy beansprouts were scattered among the noodles. Strips of garlic chives completed the dish. Instead of your usual super black and sweet flavour, you get a more savoury finish, with just the right amount of smokiness here!Dong Ji Fried Kway TeowAddress: 51 Old Airport Road, #01-138, Old Airport Road Food Centre, Singapore 390051Opening Hours: Daily 8am to 1pm.Xin Mei Xiang Lor MeeMade from starch, eggs and some secret blend of spices, it takes about 5 hours to cook before you get the smooth and light gravy. The gravy coated the noodles very nicely and portions of braised pork belly and fish are quite generous. The modern version of lor mee contains fried fish but Xin Mei Xiang’s version still sticks to tradition and tediously hand-shred Spanish mackerel. Ain’t a fan of yellow noodles? You can opt for kway teow or bee hoon or any combination of them here! I thoroughly enjoyed the textures and mix of savoury, sweet and tangy flavours. People often say, “money can’t buy happiness” but for $4, I had a well-concocted bowl of lor mee, which I see as one of life’s simple pleasures.Xin Mei Xiang Lor MeeAddress: 51 Old Airport Road, #01-116, Old Airport Road Food Centre, Singapore 390051Mobile: 9382 2238Opening Hours: Tue&Wed, Fri-Sun 6am to 1.45pm.

The otah has a good balance of chilli and fish and exudes ethereal fragrance when served hot. The filling within contains chunks of mackerel meat and the spices packs quite a punch. What I enjoyed most was the packet of traditional nasi lemak wrapped in banana leaves that this hawker still prepares. Consisting of fried fish, an egg, ikan bilis and peanuts, it made me reminisce the days when my late grandmother would tabao this back for me on weekends for breakfast when I was young.Tan Beng Otah DelightsAddress: 51 Old Airport Road, #01-74, Old Airport Road Food Centre, Singapore 390051Opening Hours: Mon-Fri 10am to 4pm.

He makes it a point to fry only one plate at a time so be prepared to wait for your plate. A plate of char kway teow consists of a mixture of flat rice noodles and egg noodles, perfectly stir-fried with eggs, cockles, lap cheong, bean sprouts and Chinese chives.

The sauce is sweet with a slight salty aftertaste. The sour chilli cranks up the tastiness of this dish and I like it that these noodles are soggy, while not overly soft at the same time. Be warned though, the queues can get quite crazy on weekends!Jia MeiAddress: Changi Village Food Centre, #01-40, 2 Changi Village Road, Singapore 500002Opening Hours: Daily 9am to 10pm.

It’s impossible to look for such comfort food within a nostalgic setting that’s affordably priced in Western countries. East-siders will be familiar with Chin Mee Chin Confectionery. Their kaya toast comes in buns rather than bread slices. These buns are made in-house and toasted till slightly charred. Generous slabs of kaya is then, spread on the buns, followed by a little chunk of butter. Imagine watching butter melting on the skillet before you cook and the aroma that lingers in the air. That’s the little action taking place on your warm toasted buns. Besides their popular kaya buns, Chin Mee Chin Confectionery is also famous for their custard cream puffs and egg tarts too!Chin Mee Chin ConfectioneryAddress: 204 E Coast Rd, Singapore 428903Opening Hours: Tue–Sun 8am to 4.30pm, Closed on MondaysYong He Bak Chor Seafood NoodlesUsed to be at Yishun, Yong He Bak Chor Seafood Noodles have relocated to Bedok a few months ago.

For $4.50 a bowl, you get a bowl of noodles tossed in homemade chilli sauce, and served with fresh prawn, clams and well braised mushroom sauce. The noodles were splendidly cooked, it’s springy, tasty, aromatic and of course, well larded. The braised mushroom slices gave the Mee Pok another delectable dimension, with its sweet and deep flavour from the prawns and clams. The deluxe $10 version comes with either big prawns or crayfish.Yong He Bak Chor Seafood NoodlesAddress: 18 Brewcoffee, Blk 18 Bedok South Road, Singapore 460018Opening Hours: 7.30am – 3pm dailyEnak Opened last year end, owner Ibu Bida gave up her corporate job to start a hawker stall. She hired a talented Indonesian cook from Tanjung Pinang to whip up a good spread of dishes. They do breakfast items in the morning. Mee Rebus ($2.50) – a simple dish of thick yellow noodles with taupok, green chilli and a hard-boiled egg drenched in a flavourful spicy-sour gravy. The gravy is not overpoweringly starchy. The star for us was the Mee Soto ($2.50). The soup has many layers of flavours and a perfect balance of spices – not one outshines the others. It is strong, rich and robust, unlike the many versions out there that are weak and lack depth of flavour. Forget about the Mee Siam.

Many people are skeptical when it comes to pig intestines due to an odour but fret not as Xing Yun’s intestines are tender and absorb the braising sauce so well that the odour is gone.

Our version is different but decent. Don’t confuse this dish with wanton mee! Kolo noodles are cooked, drained and dry-tossed with different sauces, hence the name “kolo”. Usually, the must-have ingredients are springy and oily noodles, minced pork, char siew and vegetables. Sometimes, wantons are added.Related PostTaste Good - Fall Deeper in Love with Salted Egg Yolk Here!Yummy Sarawak’s Kolo Mee doesn’t consist of minced meat but its curly kolo mee is good! These noodles are only made of egg whites, hence lighter in shade and don’t contain alkali. I can’t help but salivate when the cook tossed the noodles together with the sauces.

We also had the Chicken Feet Spare Ribs Noodles which was well-braised and flavourful.Yummy Sarawak Kolo MeeAddress: Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, #01-45, 137 Tampines Street 11, Singapore 521137Mobile: 9885 5513Opening Hours: 5am to 3pm daily.Bedok Chwee KuehOne of the cheapest chwee kueh in Singapore, Bedok Chwee Kueh is a popular breakfast for residents in the East. They are pretty generous with their radish and not very salty.

With more than 80 years of history, the stall is now managed by 3rd and 4th generation. They focus on using good and fresh ingredients, hence each bowl of bak chor mee is flavourful and tasty. Like the other BCM in Bedok 85, Tian Nan Xing has minced pork and pork balls in the noodle soup ($3). But if you add extra $1, you will get their homemade dumplings. The springy noodles with tasty soup create wonders, the soup is sweet and makes you want to have another bowl.Tian Nan Xing Minced Pork NoodleAddress: Blk 511 Bedok North St 3, 511 Food Centre #01-10, Singapore 460511Opening Hours: 7am to 1.30pm; 5.30pm to 1.30amMizzy CornerEveryone who frequents Changi Village would know about the nasi lemak served at Mizzy’s Corner. My family and I love it for its value for money, and we would invariably leave with very satisfied tummies. The standard chicken nasi lemak set which costs $3.50, comes with a fried chicken wing, a fried egg and ikan biliss, sambal and a slice of cucumber. Unfortunately, the rice is not fragrant enough and it is too soggy. A piece of mackerel otak otak can be added for an additional $1.Mizzy CornerAddress: 2 Changi Village Road, #01-26, Singapore 500002Opening Hours: Mon-Thu 7am to 11pm.

We probably spend most of our time finding good brunch places and forgot about the old traditional kuehs we used to eat when we were young. Lek Lim Nonya Cake Confectionery is a old traditional shop in Bedok which has more than 48 years of making its own ang ku kuehs, nonya kuehs and other festivals kuehs everyday. It is pretty rare because most of the ang ku kuehs we see in shops are from factories.The Soon Kuehs and Ku Cai Kuehs here are pretty famous too. The ladies make them every afternoon and the skin is soft and slippery. When steamed, the skin was translucent and thin, packed with big fat fillings. These kuehs are sold fresh everyday over the counter and contain no preservative. This stall is actually halal certified! This malay aunty here was busy wrapping the Bulok Inti, which is a sweet blue glutinous rice with coconut shredding on top.Lek Lim Nonya Cake ConfectioneryAddress: Blk 84 Bedok North St 4 #01-21, Singapore 460084Phone: +65 64490815Opening Hours: Mon – Sat 4am-6pm; Sun 4am-2pmSong Han Carrot CakeCarrot cake here thrills my tastebuds and rivets my attention. The owner of this stall serves up a generous portion of black and white carrot cake just for the price of $3. It has a texture that is soft, light and melts in your mouth right away. The tasty chilli is fragrant and not overly spicy. The uniqueness of adding small shrimps imparts a distinct crunchiness as you enjoy each morsel of food. This stall is especially suitable for families wherein some members prefer the black version with its thick and sweet dark sauce but others go for the white one that tips towards the savoury end.Song Han Carrot CakeAddress: Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, #01-07, 137 Tampines Street 11, Singapore 521137Opening Hours: 6.30am to 1pm daily.Hua Zai HK Style Roasted DelightI have very high expectations on how roast meat from a particular stall should measure up when it comes to these Hong Kong style roast cuts. Surprisingly, Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice/Noodle was a hidden gem that I stumbled upon by chance. The roast meats are very well-prepared that it’s obvious the stallholder has the roasting temperatures right at his finger tips. The roast pork is served up warm, with skin so crispy it crackles in the mouth, lending a dainty contrast to the texture of delightfully tender meat. These roast meats are served with either noodles or rice over here and I have a particular fondness for the well-seasoned char siew. The meat is succulent with a hint of sweetness. This stall serves tasty and tender soya sauce-braised chicken too.Besides roasted meats, this coffeeshop serves delicious Muslim Food too, amongst which longtong is my favourite. I enjoy the soft and fluffy texture of the rice cakes with wisps of fragrance carried over from their banana leaf wraps. The spices used are perfectly blended into the longtong, making it taste heavenly.Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice/Noodle and Muslim FoodAddress: Tampines West Foodcourt, Blk 827, Tampines Street 81, Singapore 520827Opening Hours: Roasted Delight opens daily from 8.30am to 8.30pm while Muslim Food opens daily from 6.30am to 2pm.Glory Catering Craving for Nasi Padang-styled and Nonya-styled cuisine? Glory’s the right place to head over! Their Nonya Laksa and LongTong are crowd pleasers. The former stood out for me as it is milkier and less spicy but still rich in that uniquely Nonya flovour. It comes with generous helpings of prawns, fish cakes and lemongrass sprinkled on top that helps to rack up your appetite. The LongTong here is very smooth and go after the milk curry with its feel of graininess that comes from the pinch of dried shrimps plus grated coconut dry-fried to a golden brown. The vegetables are soft and tender but not overdone.End your meal with Nonya kuehs (bite-sized pastries) are a specialty of Glory. The kuehs here contain the right amount of sweetness, texture and delivers a burst of flavours the moment you bite into them. It’s favourable to walk in with an empty stomach so you can savour all the Nonya delights you want!Glory CateringAddress: 139 East Coast Road, Singapore 428829Phone: 6344 1749Website: http://www.glorycatering.com.sg/Opening Hours: Tue-Sun&PH 8.30am to 8.30pm. Closed on Mondays.Song Zhou Carrot CakeEven though they no longer make their own carrot cake, but after getting it from supplier, they will add some “secret” ingredients to make to make it softer. The owner will first stir fry the garlic and chai poh till fragrant, then add in some carrot cake pieces, pour over the egg batter and fry with black sweet sauce and fish sauce.Song Zhou’s black carrot cake is very very fragrant and wet. Each piece of carrot cake is so soft with aromatic charred edges. What I love about it is, they are very generous with the eggs and black sauce, hence giving it a sweet and savoury taste. The white one is also not bad, but I still preferred the black ones. And to be frank, I think the uncle does a better job than the wife. The owner said, there is no secret to frying a good plate of carrot cake. What’s most important is to control the fire so that the heat will be balanced during frying.Related PostPranakorn – Thai Eatery with No Pad Thai and Pineapple Rice!Song Zhou Carrot CakeAddress: Blk 207 Bedok North Interchange #01-18, Singapore 460207Opening Hours: Monday to Saturday 7am to 8pm, closed on SundaysHock Choon Laksa and Lor MeeIt’s hard to miss this stall when there’s always a snaking queue smacked in the middle of Eunos Market and Food Centre. I enjoy its savoury gravy that is thick but not overly starchy and full of flavours. You’re able to add your desired amount of condiments which include chopped garlic, sliced chilli, sambal chilli, chopped spring onions and vinegar. Prefer a tangier taste? Pile up on the garlic and vinegar! Served with half a braised egg with my favourite kind of creamy yolk and thin slices of pork belly well-seasoned with 5 spices, having this for breakfast starts the day on a right note! Wait, did I mention about the fried fish? This is the highlight of the Lor Mee – crispy yet moist within, it complements the dish so well.Hock Choon Laksa and Lor MeeAddress: #01-25, Eunos Market and Food Centre, Blk 4A, Eunos Crescent, Singapore 402004Opening Hours: 9am to 3pm, closed on Monday and TuesdayDong Ji Fried Kway TeowThis Char Kway Teow owner does everything single-handedly, from taking orders all the way to frying it and serving the fragrant noodles into your hands. He has a perfect rhythm while frying char kway teow, adding fresh prawns and squid into the oil before the noodles. It’s hard for your stomach not to growl while waiting in line but this is definitely worth your wait.The fluffy noodles coated with spicy, eggy goodness, gives this dish a lovely taste and texture. It has enough wok hei, the right amount of charred-ness and a spice level that was perfect. The cockles were plump and some crunchy beansprouts were scattered among the noodles. Strips of garlic chives completed the dish. Instead of your usual super black and sweet flavour, you get a more savoury finish, with just the right amount of smokiness here!Dong Ji Fried Kway TeowAddress: 51 Old Airport Road, #01-138, Old Airport Road Food Centre, Singapore 390051Opening Hours: Daily 8am to 1pm.Xin Mei Xiang Lor MeeMade from starch, eggs and some secret blend of spices, it takes about 5 hours to cook before you get the smooth and light gravy. The gravy coated the noodles very nicely and portions of braised pork belly and fish are quite generous. The modern version of lor mee contains fried fish but Xin Mei Xiang’s version still sticks to tradition and tediously hand-shred Spanish mackerel. Ain’t a fan of yellow noodles? You can opt for kway teow or bee hoon or any combination of them here! I thoroughly enjoyed the textures and mix of savoury, sweet and tangy flavours. People often say, “money can’t buy happiness” but for $4, I had a well-concocted bowl of lor mee, which I see as one of life’s simple pleasures.Xin Mei Xiang Lor MeeAddress: 51 Old Airport Road, #01-116, Old Airport Road Food Centre, Singapore 390051Mobile: 9382 2238Opening Hours: Tue&Wed, Fri-Sun 6am to 1.45pm.

The otah has a good balance of chilli and fish and exudes ethereal fragrance when served hot. The filling within contains chunks of mackerel meat and the spices packs quite a punch. What I enjoyed most was the packet of traditional nasi lemak wrapped in banana leaves that this hawker still prepares. Consisting of fried fish, an egg, ikan bilis and peanuts, it made me reminisce the days when my late grandmother would tabao this back for me on weekends for breakfast when I was young.Tan Beng Otah DelightsAddress: 51 Old Airport Road, #01-74, Old Airport Road Food Centre, Singapore 390051Opening Hours: Mon-Fri 10am to 4pm.

He makes it a point to fry only one plate at a time so be prepared to wait for your plate. A plate of char kway teow consists of a mixture of flat rice noodles and egg noodles, perfectly stir-fried with eggs, cockles, lap cheong, bean sprouts and Chinese chives. I’m not sure which particular stall you frequent but I grew up eating from this old uncle hence, sharing my wonderful childhood experience with you.Da Zhong Mei Shi Char Kway TeowAddress: Changi Village Food Centre, #01-19, 2 Changi Village Road, Singapore 500002Opening Hours: Daily 7am to 10pm.Jia Mei Wanton MeeMany might be familiar with this hawker’s wanton noodles but I prefer their mushrooms and chicken feet noodles, soaked in their special sauce. The sauce is sweet with a slight salty aftertaste. The sour chilli cranks up the tastiness of this dish and I like it that these noodles are soggy, while not overly soft at the same time. Be warned though, the queues can get quite crazy on weekends!Jia MeiAddress: Changi Village Food Centre, #01-40, 2 Changi Village Road, Singapore 500002Opening Hours: Daily 9am to 10pm.

Dishes include luncheon meat, fried kuning fish, fishcakes, stir fry long beans, ikan bilis, otah, fried eggs etc. Its nasi lemak is very light and fluffy because they use coconut milk sparingly.

Here’s a list of breakfast spots in the East that will make you reconsider waking up early. Enjoy!   Mr and Mrs Mohgan’s Super Crispy Roti Prata Good, artisanal pratas are hard to come by. Meet Mr and Mrs Mohgan, the couple who does super crispy roti prata in the middle of Joo Chiat. Mr Mohgan has been making prata for more than 30 years. He makes his own dough, cooked the curry and flips the prata all by himself. What’s the best way to find out if the prata is good? Eat the kosong (plain) one! I ordered a stack for my foreigner friends to try and they were full of complements. Moderately thick and pan fried till a beautiful brown, the pratas here are fresh and SUPER CRISPY.

It’s impossible to look for such comfort food within a nostalgic setting that’s affordably priced in Western countries. East-siders will be familiar with Chin Mee Chin Confectionery. Their kaya toast comes in buns rather than bread slices. These buns are made in-house and toasted till slightly charred. Generous slabs of kaya is then, spread on the buns, followed by a little chunk of butter. Imagine watching butter melting on the skillet before you cook and the aroma that lingers in the air. That’s the little action taking place on your warm toasted buns. Besides their popular kaya buns, Chin Mee Chin Confectionery is also famous for their custard cream puffs and egg tarts too!Chin Mee Chin ConfectioneryAddress: 204 E Coast Rd, Singapore 428903Opening Hours: Tue–Sun 8am to 4.30pm, Closed on MondaysYong He Bak Chor Seafood NoodlesUsed to be at Yishun, Yong He Bak Chor Seafood Noodles have relocated to Bedok a few months ago. He is actually the uncle of Ah Guan Noodles and brother of Ah Lam’s Abalone Noodles! So the whole family has been targeting seafood noodle! For $4.50 a bowl, you get a bowl of noodles tossed in homemade chilli sauce, and served with fresh prawn, clams and well braised mushroom sauce. The noodles were splendidly cooked, it’s springy, tasty, aromatic and of course, well larded. The braised mushroom slices gave the Mee Pok another delectable dimension, with its sweet and deep flavour from the prawns and clams. The deluxe $10 version comes with either big prawns or crayfish.Yong He Bak Chor Seafood NoodlesAddress: 18 Brewcoffee, Blk 18 Bedok South Road, Singapore 460018Opening Hours: 7.30am – 3pm dailyEnak Opened last year end, owner Ibu Bida gave up her corporate job to start a hawker stall. She hired a talented Indonesian cook from Tanjung Pinang to whip up a good spread of dishes. They do breakfast items in the morning. Mee Rebus ($2.50) – a simple dish of thick yellow noodles with taupok, green chilli and a hard-boiled egg drenched in a flavourful spicy-sour gravy. The gravy is not overpoweringly starchy. The star for us was the Mee Soto ($2.50). The soup has many layers of flavours and a perfect balance of spices – not one outshines the others. It is strong, rich and robust, unlike the many versions out there that are weak and lack depth of flavour. Forget about the Mee Siam. Read about our previous review.EnakAddress: Blk 16 Bedok South Road Market & Food Centre, Singapore 460016Opening Hours: 7am to 4pm, Closed on Tuesdays.Ru Ji KitchenYoung hawkers Joanne and Daniel learnt the skill from Joanne’s father and they wake up very early everyday to make the fishballs. Using yellow tail fish (蕃薯鱼), they beats them into fish paste for an hour before making it into fishballs and fish cakes. That is why their fishballs are so fresh and bouncy! The mee pok is very springy and well-tossed with their homemade chilli sauce, vinegar and lard.Ru Ji KitchenAddress: Old Airport Road Food Centre #01-37, 51 Old Airport Road, Singapore 390051Opening Hours: Tue-Sun 7.30am to 1pm.

He picked up his skills at a local kaya toast chain when he was 17 years old. After working there for three years, he opened his own stall in Old Airport Road Food Centre in 2007, serving kaya toast paired with home-brewed traditional coffee, which he learnt from his father. Aside from the signature items, he serves blended ice coffee to cater to his young customers and freshly made sandwiches using traditional kaya toast bread. In response to the health consciousness of Singaporeans, kaya used in Mr. Soh’s stall is specially created to make it less sweet and not cloying when served with coffee or tea.Toast HutAddress: Old Airport Road Food Centre #01-52, Blk 51 Old Airport Road, Singapore 390051Opening Hours: 6:30 am to 3 pm, closed on Thursdays)Fu Yuan Minced Pork Noodle Occupying just half a stall at Tampines Street 21, Fu Yuan Teochew Bak Chor Mee is really an unassuming establishment. The owner is formerly working as an assistant with Twa Hua when he was a young boy. At first glance, the mee pok looked a tad dry. But once the noodle and sauce were tossed up, they came together nicely. The noodles sits in a small pool of vinegar-based sauce and which is slurping good. Especially the vinegar, very fragrant and seems like it’s a superior brand. Topping the al-dente noodles are a mixture of minced pork, liver, pork balls, fried sole fish, etc. You get a bowl of soup on the side as well. Read about the full review here.Fu Yuan Minced Pork NoodleAddress: 201C Tampines Street 21, Singapore 523201Opening Hours: 6am-230pm, 5pm -8pm, closed every 2 weeks on the WednesdayXing Yun Kway Chap Business is overwhelmingly good that this kway chap stall only opens from Friday to Sunday so expect long queues forming. Well, good things are worth the wait right?! Queuing must be one of Singaporeans’ favourite pastimes. Standing in the queue with groups of aunties and teenagers chatting at the top of their voices made me feel as though I’m in a mini wet market.Xing Yun’s kway chap are braised to perfection. The translucent kway is slippery smooth and does not break easily in the sweet and aromatic broth. The braised pork belly, pig’s intestines and tau pok are well-flavoured. We enjoyed the braising sauce’s good consistency as it is not too thick nor too watery. The ingredients are stewed long enough for the spices to penetrate into them. Many people are skeptical when it comes to pig intestines due to an odour but fret not as Xing Yun’s intestines are tender and absorb the braising sauce so well that the odour is gone. Adventurous foodies can attempt to try pig’s tongue while big-eaters should definitely go for the pig trotters! Dip the morsels into a tangy spicy chilli sauce for that extra kick!Xing Yun Kway ChapAddress: Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, #01-14, 137 Tampines Street 11, Singapore 521137Opening Hours: Fri-Sun 8am to 1pm.Chai Chee Fried Carrot CakeWhen every other stall’s deep fried carrot cake is square, Chai Chee’s version is long and freshly deep fried. Each carrot cake stick is crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside. It is one of my favourite breakfast snack whenever I am in Bedok. Best paired with Rui Xing Ka Fei Cha Shi stall located at #01-42.Chai Chee Fried Carrot CakeAddress: Blk 216 Bedok North St 1 Market and Food Centre #01-55, Singapore 460216Yummy Sarawak Kolo Mee Being the top foodie pick in Sarawak, of course Singapore’s version cannot be compared to those served in Sarawak. Our version is different but decent. Don’t confuse this dish with wanton mee! Kolo noodles are cooked, drained and dry-tossed with different sauces, hence the name “kolo”. Usually, the must-have ingredients are springy and oily noodles, minced pork, char siew and vegetables. Sometimes, wantons are added.Related PostTaste Good - Fall Deeper in Love with Salted Egg Yolk Here!Yummy Sarawak’s Kolo Mee doesn’t consist of minced meat but its curly kolo mee is good! These noodles are only made of egg whites, hence lighter in shade and don’t contain alkali. I can’t help but salivate when the cook tossed the noodles together with the sauces. I guess the fragrance makes the stomachs of everyone who are still in the queue growl with hunger. Huge wantons with crunchy water chestnuts complement the noodles so don’t miss out on these! We also had the Chicken Feet Spare Ribs Noodles which was well-braised and flavourful.Yummy Sarawak Kolo MeeAddress: Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, #01-45, 137 Tampines Street 11, Singapore 521137Mobile: 9885 5513Opening Hours: 5am to 3pm daily.Bedok Chwee KuehOne of the cheapest chwee kueh in Singapore, Bedok Chwee Kueh is a popular breakfast for residents in the East.

It is pretty rare because most of the ang ku kuehs we see in shops are from factories.The Soon Kuehs and Ku Cai Kuehs here are pretty famous too.

Surprisingly, Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice/Noodle was a hidden gem that I stumbled upon by chance. The roast meats are very well-prepared that it’s obvious the stallholder has the roasting temperatures right at his finger tips. The roast pork is served up warm, with skin so crispy it crackles in the mouth, lending a dainty contrast to the texture of delightfully tender meat.

Each piece of carrot cake is so soft with aromatic charred edges. What I love about it is, they are very generous with the eggs and black sauce, hence giving it a sweet and savoury taste. The white one is also not bad, but I still preferred the black ones. And to be frank, I think the uncle does a better job than the wife.

Meet Mr and Mrs Mohgan, the couple who does super crispy roti prata in the middle of Joo Chiat. Mr Mohgan has been making prata for more than 30 years. He makes his own dough, cooked the curry and flips the prata all by himself. What’s the best way to find out if the prata is good? Eat the kosong (plain) one! I ordered a stack for my foreigner friends to try and they were full of complements. Moderately thick and pan fried till a beautiful brown, the pratas here are fresh and SUPER CRISPY.

It’s impossible to look for such comfort food within a nostalgic setting that’s affordably priced in Western countries. East-siders will be familiar with Chin Mee Chin Confectionery. Their kaya toast comes in buns rather than bread slices. These buns are made in-house and toasted till slightly charred. Generous slabs of kaya is then, spread on the buns, followed by a little chunk of butter. Imagine watching butter melting on the skillet before you cook and the aroma that lingers in the air. That’s the little action taking place on your warm toasted buns. Besides their popular kaya buns, Chin Mee Chin Confectionery is also famous for their custard cream puffs and egg tarts too!Chin Mee Chin ConfectioneryAddress: 204 E Coast Rd, Singapore 428903Opening Hours: Tue–Sun 8am to 4.30pm, Closed on MondaysYong He Bak Chor Seafood NoodlesUsed to be at Yishun, Yong He Bak Chor Seafood Noodles have relocated to Bedok a few months ago. He is actually the uncle of Ah Guan Noodles and brother of Ah Lam’s Abalone Noodles! So the whole family has been targeting seafood noodle! For $4.50 a bowl, you get a bowl of noodles tossed in homemade chilli sauce, and served with fresh prawn, clams and well braised mushroom sauce. The noodles were splendidly cooked, it’s springy, tasty, aromatic and of course, well larded. The braised mushroom slices gave the Mee Pok another delectable dimension, with its sweet and deep flavour from the prawns and clams. The deluxe $10 version comes with either big prawns or crayfish.Yong He Bak Chor Seafood NoodlesAddress: 18 Brewcoffee, Blk 18 Bedok South Road, Singapore 460018Opening Hours: 7.30am – 3pm dailyEnak Opened last year end, owner Ibu Bida gave up her corporate job to start a hawker stall. She hired a talented Indonesian cook from Tanjung Pinang to whip up a good spread of dishes. They do breakfast items in the morning. Mee Rebus ($2.50) – a simple dish of thick yellow noodles with taupok, green chilli and a hard-boiled egg drenched in a flavourful spicy-sour gravy. The gravy is not overpoweringly starchy. The star for us was the Mee Soto ($2.50). The soup has many layers of flavours and a perfect balance of spices – not one outshines the others. It is strong, rich and robust, unlike the many versions out there that are weak and lack depth of flavour. Forget about the Mee Siam. Read about our previous review.EnakAddress: Blk 16 Bedok South Road Market & Food Centre, Singapore 460016Opening Hours: 7am to 4pm, Closed on Tuesdays.Ru Ji KitchenYoung hawkers Joanne and Daniel learnt the skill from Joanne’s father and they wake up very early everyday to make the fishballs. Using yellow tail fish (蕃薯鱼), they beats them into fish paste for an hour before making it into fishballs and fish cakes. That is why their fishballs are so fresh and bouncy! The mee pok is very springy and well-tossed with their homemade chilli sauce, vinegar and lard.Ru Ji KitchenAddress: Old Airport Road Food Centre #01-37, 51 Old Airport Road, Singapore 390051Opening Hours: Tue-Sun 7.30am to 1pm. Closed on Mondays.Toast Hut Toast Hut is the place for traditional kaya (coconut jam) toast set by young hawker Melvin Soh. He picked up his skills at a local kaya toast chain when he was 17 years old. After working there for three years, he opened his own stall in Old Airport Road Food Centre in 2007, serving kaya toast paired with home-brewed traditional coffee, which he learnt from his father. Aside from the signature items, he serves blended ice coffee to cater to his young customers and freshly made sandwiches using traditional kaya toast bread. In response to the health consciousness of Singaporeans, kaya used in Mr. Soh’s stall is specially created to make it less sweet and not cloying when served with coffee or tea.Toast HutAddress: Old Airport Road Food Centre #01-52, Blk 51 Old Airport Road, Singapore 390051Opening Hours: 6:30 am to 3 pm, closed on Thursdays)Fu Yuan Minced Pork Noodle Occupying just half a stall at Tampines Street 21, Fu Yuan Teochew Bak Chor Mee is really an unassuming establishment. The owner is formerly working as an assistant with Twa Hua when he was a young boy. At first glance, the mee pok looked a tad dry. But once the noodle and sauce were tossed up, they came together nicely. The noodles sits in a small pool of vinegar-based sauce and which is slurping good. Especially the vinegar, very fragrant and seems like it’s a superior brand. Topping the al-dente noodles are a mixture of minced pork, liver, pork balls, fried sole fish, etc. You get a bowl of soup on the side as well. Read about the full review here.Fu Yuan Minced Pork NoodleAddress: 201C Tampines Street 21, Singapore 523201Opening Hours: 6am-230pm, 5pm -8pm, closed every 2 weeks on the WednesdayXing Yun Kway Chap Business is overwhelmingly good that this kway chap stall only opens from Friday to Sunday so expect long queues forming. Well, good things are worth the wait right?! Queuing must be one of Singaporeans’ favourite pastimes. Standing in the queue with groups of aunties and teenagers chatting at the top of their voices made me feel as though I’m in a mini wet market.Xing Yun’s kway chap are braised to perfection. The translucent kway is slippery smooth and does not break easily in the sweet and aromatic broth. The braised pork belly, pig’s intestines and tau pok are well-flavoured. We enjoyed the braising sauce’s good consistency as it is not too thick nor too watery. The ingredients are stewed long enough for the spices to penetrate into them. Many people are skeptical when it comes to pig intestines due to an odour but fret not as Xing Yun’s intestines are tender and absorb the braising sauce so well that the odour is gone. Adventurous foodies can attempt to try pig’s tongue while big-eaters should definitely go for the pig trotters! Dip the morsels into a tangy spicy chilli sauce for that extra kick!Xing Yun Kway ChapAddress: Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, #01-14, 137 Tampines Street 11, Singapore 521137Opening Hours: Fri-Sun 8am to 1pm.Chai Chee Fried Carrot CakeWhen every other stall’s deep fried carrot cake is square, Chai Chee’s version is long and freshly deep fried. Each carrot cake stick is crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside. It is one of my favourite breakfast snack whenever I am in Bedok. Best paired with Rui Xing Ka Fei Cha Shi stall located at #01-42.Chai Chee Fried Carrot CakeAddress: Blk 216 Bedok North St 1 Market and Food Centre #01-55, Singapore 460216Yummy Sarawak Kolo Mee Being the top foodie pick in Sarawak, of course Singapore’s version cannot be compared to those served in Sarawak. Our version is different but decent. Don’t confuse this dish with wanton mee! Kolo noodles are cooked, drained and dry-tossed with different sauces, hence the name “kolo”. Usually, the must-have ingredients are springy and oily noodles, minced pork, char siew and vegetables. Sometimes, wantons are added.Related PostTaste Good - Fall Deeper in Love with Salted Egg Yolk Here!Yummy Sarawak’s Kolo Mee doesn’t consist of minced meat but its curly kolo mee is good! These noodles are only made of egg whites, hence lighter in shade and don’t contain alkali. I can’t help but salivate when the cook tossed the noodles together with the sauces. I guess the fragrance makes the stomachs of everyone who are still in the queue growl with hunger. Huge wantons with crunchy water chestnuts complement the noodles so don’t miss out on these! We also had the Chicken Feet Spare Ribs Noodles which was well-braised and flavourful.Yummy Sarawak Kolo MeeAddress: Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, #01-45, 137 Tampines Street 11, Singapore 521137Mobile: 9885 5513Opening Hours: 5am to 3pm daily.Bedok Chwee KuehOne of the cheapest chwee kueh in Singapore, Bedok Chwee Kueh is a popular breakfast for residents in the East. They are pretty generous with their radish and not very salty.

Like the other BCM in Bedok 85, Tian Nan Xing has minced pork and pork balls in the noodle soup ($3). But if you add extra $1, you will get their homemade dumplings. The springy noodles with tasty soup create wonders, the soup is sweet and makes you want to have another bowl.Tian Nan Xing Minced Pork NoodleAddress: Blk 511 Bedok North St 3, 511 Food Centre #01-10, Singapore 460511Opening Hours: 7am to 1.30pm; 5.30pm to 1.30amMizzy CornerEveryone who frequents Changi Village would know about the nasi lemak served at Mizzy’s Corner. My family and I love it for its value for money, and we would invariably leave with very satisfied tummies. The standard chicken nasi lemak set which costs $3.50, comes with a fried chicken wing, a fried egg and ikan biliss, sambal and a slice of cucumber. Unfortunately, the rice is not fragrant enough and it is too soggy. A piece of mackerel otak otak can be added for an additional $1.Mizzy CornerAddress: 2 Changi Village Road, #01-26, Singapore 500002Opening Hours: Mon-Thu 7am to 11pm.

We probably spend most of our time finding good brunch places and forgot about the old traditional kuehs we used to eat when we were young. Lek Lim Nonya Cake Confectionery is a old traditional shop in Bedok which has more than 48 years of making its own ang ku kuehs, nonya kuehs and other festivals kuehs everyday. It is pretty rare because most of the ang ku kuehs we see in shops are from factories.The Soon Kuehs and Ku Cai Kuehs here are pretty famous too. The ladies make them every afternoon and the skin is soft and slippery. When steamed, the skin was translucent and thin, packed with big fat fillings. These kuehs are sold fresh everyday over the counter and contain no preservative. This stall is actually halal certified!

The owner of this stall serves up a generous portion of black and white carrot cake just for the price of $3. It has a texture that is soft, light and melts in your mouth right away. The tasty chilli is fragrant and not overly spicy. The uniqueness of adding small shrimps imparts a distinct crunchiness as you enjoy each morsel of food.

Surprisingly, Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice/Noodle was a hidden gem that I stumbled upon by chance. The roast meats are very well-prepared that it’s obvious the stallholder has the roasting temperatures right at his finger tips. The roast pork is served up warm, with skin so crispy it crackles in the mouth, lending a dainty contrast to the texture of delightfully tender meat. These roast meats are served with either noodles or rice over here and I have a particular fondness for the well-seasoned char siew. The meat is succulent with a hint of sweetness. This stall serves tasty and tender soya sauce-braised chicken too.Besides roasted meats, this coffeeshop serves delicious Muslim Food too, amongst which longtong is my favourite.

I’m not sure which particular stall you frequent but I grew up eating from this old uncle hence, sharing my wonderful childhood experience with you.Da Zhong Mei Shi Char Kway TeowAddress: Changi Village Food Centre, #01-19, 2 Changi Village Road, Singapore 500002Opening Hours: Daily 7am to 10pm.Jia Mei Wanton MeeMany might be familiar with this hawker’s wanton noodles but I prefer their mushrooms and chicken feet noodles, soaked in their special sauce. The sauce is sweet with a slight salty aftertaste. The sour chilli cranks up the tastiness of this dish and I like it that these noodles are soggy, while not overly soft at the same time. Be warned though, the queues can get quite crazy on weekends!Jia MeiAddress: Changi Village Food Centre, #01-40, 2 Changi Village Road, Singapore 500002Opening Hours: Daily 9am to 10pm. Closed on Mondays.Joo Chiat Chiap Kee Joo Chiat Chiap Kee in Bedok makes their own dome shape fishballs that is fresh, chewy and gives a satisfying homely taste! Their sambal chilli is to die for. When tossed with my noodles and bean sprouts, it is super shiok. For $3, we get 5 fishballs, worth it right?Joo Chiat Chiap KeeAddress: Blk 216 Bedok North Food Centre #01-31, Singapore 460216Opening Hours: Daily 7am to 1.30pmHon Ni KitchenReaders staying in Bedok have definitely heard about Hon Ni Kitchen for its nasi lemak. It is always long queue during lunch and the only time when it does not have a queue, is Sunday. Because the stall is closed on Sunday! Go for their chicken wing, it is deep fried till crispy. Dishes include luncheon meat, fried kuning fish, fishcakes, stir fry long beans, ikan bilis, otah, fried eggs etc. Its nasi lemak is very light and fluffy because they use coconut milk sparingly. The rice is best eaten with their homemade sambal chilli sauce.Hon Ni KitchenAddress: Blk 216 Bedok North Street 1 #01-07, Singapore 460216Opening Hours: 7.30am to 2pm, closed on Sunday & MondayKim Choo Kueh ChangYou name it, they got it! Offering an abundance of rice dumplings with different stuffing, Kim Choo definitely doesn’t disappoint. The ingredients are pretty generous here and very tasty. No matter which flavour of rice dumpling you select, you’ll realize that the rice was not in any overwhelmed by the ingredients. The glutinous rice was soft but compact, with a nice aroma. Each rice grain fully absorbed the essence of the ingredients wrapped within. You get a complete package that’s so flavoursome you can’t just stop at one.Kim Choo Kueh ChangAddress: 60/62 Joo Chiat Place, Singapore 427784/85Phone: 6344 0830Opening Hours: Daily 10am to 10pm.Planning what to do or where to eat over the weekend?

As with every cheap budget buffet list article, there is always a catch. The prices here mostly do not include GST/service charge, so the total fee per pax might/will go above twenty dollars depending on the number of people you bring.This article works best to let you know exactly when and where to go to stretch your dollar.




Stop wasting your money on overpriced buffets that just aren’t worth it. If you have a craving and you want to satisfy it endlessly with just that without thinking about the price tag. You have come to the right place.  From Korean BBQs, Shabu Shabu to Dimsum budget buffets – In the words of Taylor Swift, “I could show you incredible things.”


1. Little Ice Cream Kafe (LICK)
 
The ice cream buffet here runs only on fridays from 2 – 4pm and 6 – 8pm. You are entitled to as many waffles as you would like with your gelato inclusive of toppings. The buffet procedure is rather simple; queue behind the counter and pick which flavors of ice cream you would like. Help yourself to the waffles at the side.
I recommend the Avocado gelato, they capture the natural buttery flavor perfectly without it being too sweet. Something most half-baked ice cream cafes compensate by drowning their ice cream with Gula Melaka. Pffft. Try their Kaya Ice cream here too, something I bet you’ve never seen anywhere else.
Address: 258 Tanjong Katong Road | http://lick.com.sg | Opening hours: Sun – Thu: 13:00 – 23:00 Fri – Sat: 11:00 – 00:00
2. KISEKI
 
$19.80++ for weekday lunches for free flow sashimi, chawamushi and fresh seafood. Kiseki is the Singapore standard to what a good buffet deal should be about. They have an extensive list of Japanese cuisine that includes yakitori, tempura and teppanyaki too.
Their dessert bar is pretty good too,  hosting a variety of cakes, mochi and gelatos with interesting flavors like yuzu and wasabi –  Kiseki never disappoints. As a tip, make a reservation before you come or risk waiting an entire hour to get in. I have tried too many times hoping otherwise and ended up with the dreaded wait.
Address: #08-01/02/03, Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road | Website| Opening hours: Daily 11:30 – 15:00 and 18:00 – 22:30 
3. SUKI-YA
 
I will be the first to say that SUKI-YA does not have an extensive selection. They have the right bases covered for a good Shabu Shabu – enoki, oden, different vegetables like cabbage and carrots to flavor the soup.
The prices here though are what really deserves a shout-out. On weekdays from 11.30am – 3pm, the 80 minutes buffet is as low as $14.90++ at I12 Katong Mall, and at $16.90++ at Plaza Singapura. Do note there’s an additional $3 fee on Fridays. Exclusively at I12 Katong mall, enjoy shabu shabu in a group of four and one dines free!
They have many outlets strewn across Singapore. East to west, from Bukit Panjang, Plaza Sing, Bugis + to Tampines mall, SUKI-YA  is the perfect place to arrange a catch up with friends over good old Shabu Shabu. The offers vary across different outlets, so do check out their promotions page for the most updated info.
Address: Refer here for a list of all their other outlets
4. SSIKKEK Korean BBQ
 
As per most Korean BBQs buffets in Singapore, you have a wide variety of meats with different cuts that range from pork collar, boneless chicken to marinated beef strips. A weekday lunch here is only at $14.90++.


Their cooked menu is limited to a few dishes like sweet potato, Topoki and onion pancakes but it doesn’t bother me much though. When it comes down to kBBQ, I am only in it for the meat so the limited cooked menu is fine.
They have 3 outlets in Singapore: United Square, Tanjong Pagar and Chinatown. They do not have a main website so you will have to google these individual outlets yourself. Also, check out their April promotion at the United Square outlet where weekend lunches are at $18/pax ++!
Address: 101 Thomson Road, Singapore 307591 (United Square Outlet) | 6254 8123 | Opening Hours for Lunch: 11:30am ~ 2:30pm (Daily Except PH) for Dinner: Sun ~ Thur, PH : 5:30pm ~ 12am Fri, Sat, Day Before PH : 5:30pm ~ 2am
5. House of Steamboat

Inside the store, there is a decent selection of yong tau fu items to choose from – Taupok, meatballs, fishballs, fish maw etc. It is in my personal opinion that most steamboat food usually tastes the same anyway so I am not too picky about food.
There is also an a la carte menu you order simple dishes like fried chicken drumlets, fried fish and mantous from. You can pay an extra $2 to have a grill for your food but I  don’t find it necessary. I like to come here for weekend dinners with old friends over steamboat.
At only $20nett per pax, you cannot find anything cheaper for a weekend buffet dinner. Don’t dress too nice if you’re paying the place a visit, everyone works up a little sweat during steamboat.
Address: 7 Tan Quee Lan St, Singapore 188096 | Tel number: +65 63362875 | Open daily from 12pm – 12am
6. Shabu Sai

Shabu Sai has seasonal soup broths from time to time. Like their Yuzu salt beauty ‘collagen’ soup in july last year. I always fall back on the Tonkotsu soup base anyway, it’s a safer option. They serve the usual Shabu Shabu, 3 meats with a healthy array of vegetables, sushi and ice-cream on the side for dessert.


With 6 outlets throughout Singapore mainly in central (Clarke Quay, Orchard Central,Suntec City) and the east (Changi City point, Eastpoint) with one outlet in the north (Causeway point), I recommend coming here for lunch on weekdays ($16.50++). The place still hits below the budget at $18.50++ on weekends too though.
Address: 181 Orchard Road, 08-09/10/11 Orchard Central, Singapore 238896 | Opening hours:  Mon – Fri: 11:00 – 15:00 and 18:00 – 22:00 Sat – Sun: 11:30 – 22:30 | Refer here for a full list of their other outlets mentioned earlier
7. Swensens Dessert Buffet (ION Orchard)
Photo: beverlys.com
Free flow waffles with brownies and cakes to pair with over 50 different ce cream types of your choice. The buffet runs 7 days a week and is exclusive to their Ion Orchard outlet. It does not come cheap though with the extended variety, the buffet is priced at $18.90 per pax. $12.90 if you get a main course separately before that.
I recommend this place only for the dessert junkie because only those with a sweet tooth can appreciate what they have here free flow. No where else can you get such an extensive range of gelato and ice cream with 40 types of toppings and a mix-in service too. Forget that silly Marble Slab Groupon deal, Swensen’s dessert buffet is the real deal.
Address: (Located inside Orchard Central) 2 Orchard Turn, #B1-31 | Tel: 68845967  | Opening hours: [Weekdays] 10.30am – 10.30pm [Weekends & PH] 8am-10.30pm
8. Kim Korean Zubir
 
A stone’s throw away from SOTA, the place is ridiculously priced at only $14++ on weekday lunches. Students have it even better with a special price at $12.90. At prices like these, I dare say it is one of the cheapest kBBQs in Singapore.
As per most Korean BBQ places, Kim Korean Zubir has the standard meat cuts with a cooked selection a tad bit more than Sikeiski. Dishes like fried chicken, ginseng soup, nuggets as a lead up to the Korean meats. There is only one drawback though, the place lacks smoke chimneys so you will stink a bit after the meal but at these prices I honestly could not care less.
Address: School Of The Arts Singapore, 1 Zubir Said Drive #01-04/07 Singapore 227968 (Dhoby Ghaut) | Tel: 6238 7218 | Opening hours: Mon – Fri: 11:30 – 14:30, Mon – Fri: 17:00 – 23:00 and Sat – Sun: 11:30 – 23:00
9. Lao Beijing
Photo: springtomorrow.com
While this buffet might be on the cheaper end ($13.99/pax during weekday High Tea) , the one caveat to it is the awkward eating timing from 3 – 5pm.  Have a heavy brunch before coming to Lao Beijing for your high tea. In the restaurant itself, a few simple dishes like fried noodles, custard buns (sadly not the runny type), siumai are laid out on the side.
The good stuff like the XLB, guotie, jiaozi are mostly on the paper menu. Its made this way so the dishes will always be served piping hot to customers. One of the cheapest deals in town, the limited variety of food items is very well worth overlooking for – What more can you ask for free flow XLBs at prices like these?

10. Ban Heng Harborfront center
Source: sparklette.com
Compared to Lao Beijing, the variety dim-sum wise is a lot more extensive. Of course, it is priced proportionally more too. At $19.30++ per pax, the buffet runs from 11.30am – 2.30pm everyday. They have the usual dim sum essentials like har-gow, prawn rolls, shrimp dumplings etc but as a disclaimer – no egg tarts.
The service here can be rather slow so try to order as many dishes as you can each time you send one order in. Do not make intermittent orders where you may have your order missed out. Sadly, this dim sum buffet is also only exclusive to their Harbourfront outlet. It’s available on weekends too so I wouldn’t mind making my way down for some good old (cheap) dim sum.

11. King’s Laksa Steamboat
Credit


True to its name, this restaurant offers a wide enough variety of food befitting of a king’s feast. Unbelievable? I know. This restaurant boasts an array of over 80 steamboat ingredients that pairs wonderfully with their two soup bases; Laksa and Mala. 


In addition, the restaurant is situated in Serangoon that’s slightly detached from the general hustle and bustle of Central Singapore. Which ultimately makes it an ideal place to relax and hang out with your buddies.
Lunch: Mon-Fri steamboat buffet lunch $21.80++ per pax, from 11am – 2.59pm

12. Chili Padi Nonya Cafe

If you’ve got a carving for Peranakan cuisine, the buffet offered by Chili Padi Nonya Cafe is as authentic as it gets around here.
Its buffet lunch is priced at ($18.80) available from Monday to Friday from 11.15am – 3pm and Buffet Hi-Tea at a ridiculously low price of ($12.80) available only on Weekends and Public Holidays from 3pm – 5.15pm.
Dive back into Singapore’s heritage with traditional Nonya cuisine such as Braised Nonya Chap Chye, Itek Sio, Ayam Bua Kuluak and not to mention their wealth of pastries as well! Also, they have catering services so do check that out as well.

14. Al Jasra Restaurant / Kasi Villa

Probably the cheapest Prata buffet around right now at only $6.90/person for 16 different prata flavours at Kasi Villa.
So if you’re broke and really hungry, you know where to go. BUT bring your friends because this is only applicable when there are at least 4 diners.

15. Crystal Cafe

A lesser known porridge buffet compared to Quality Cafe, Crystal Cafe deserves some attention too.
Considering the spread of dishes available including pastries and desserts, coffee and tea, the prices are pretty damn affordable.  Their Sweet Potato Porridge has received quite some praise.
Mon-Thurs(Lunch &Dinner), Friday (Lunch): $14.80++
Friday (Dinner), Sat-Sun, PH & PH eve: $16.80++
Lunch hours: 12PM-2:30PM, Dinner: 6-10PM

16. K.Cook Korean BBQ



Conveniently located in town with a view overlooking orchard and yet at a crazy affordable price.
When I go for Korean BBQ, the smell of the place tends to overwhelm me sometimes but at K.Cook, the place is spacious, with high ceilings and a big ass fan hence I assume the ventilation would be good.

Apart from the standard BBQ fare, they also offer cooked Korean dishes like Japchae, Pancake and Spicy Tofu Stew. To top this off with a cherry, you’d be happy to know that canned drinks and condiments are free flow.
You can literally feast till you conceive a food baby.
K.Cook is part of our 15 best Korean BBQ Restaurants. For more information, check out our review of K.Cook Korean BBQ here.
Buffet Lunch (Monday – Friday) $14.90++ from 11:30AM – 3PM

Editor’s End Note
Please do share any other cheap budget buffets you know below twenty dollars. It does not have to be from some mega chain outlet.  As long as its below the budget we would be more than happy to add it into this list! And if there are too many responses, we would probably start a whole new entry altogether.

As with every cheap budget buffet list article, there is always a catch. The prices here mostly do not include GST/service charge, so the total fee per pax might/will go above twenty dollars depending on the number of people you bring.This article works best to let you know exactly when and where to go to stretch your dollar.




Stop wasting your money on overpriced buffets that just aren’t worth it. If you have a craving and you want to satisfy it endlessly with just that without thinking about the price tag. You have come to the right place.  From Korean BBQs, Shabu Shabu to Dimsum budget buffets – In the words of Taylor Swift, “I could show you incredible things.”


1. Little Ice Cream Kafe (LICK)
 
The ice cream buffet here runs only on fridays from 2 – 4pm and 6 – 8pm. You are entitled to as many waffles as you would like with your gelato inclusive of toppings. The buffet procedure is rather simple; queue behind the counter and pick which flavors of ice cream you would like. Help yourself to the waffles at the side.
I recommend the Avocado gelato, they capture the natural buttery flavor perfectly without it being too sweet. Something most half-baked ice cream cafes compensate by drowning their ice cream with Gula Melaka. Pffft. Try their Kaya Ice cream here too, something I bet you’ve never seen anywhere else.
Address: 258 Tanjong Katong Road | http://lick.com.sg | Opening hours: Sun – Thu: 13:00 – 23:00 Fri – Sat: 11:00 – 00:00
2. KISEKI
 
$19.80++ for weekday lunches for free flow sashimi, chawamushi and fresh seafood. Kiseki is the Singapore standard to what a good buffet deal should be about. They have an extensive list of Japanese cuisine that includes yakitori, tempura and teppanyaki too.
Their dessert bar is pretty good too,  hosting a variety of cakes, mochi and gelatos with interesting flavors like yuzu and wasabi –  Kiseki never disappoints. As a tip, make a reservation before you come or risk waiting an entire hour to get in. I have tried too many times hoping otherwise and ended up with the dreaded wait.
Address: #08-01/02/03, Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road | Website| Opening hours: Daily 11:30 – 15:00 and 18:00 – 22:30 
3. SUKI-YA
 
I will be the first to say that SUKI-YA does not have an extensive selection. They have the right bases covered for a good Shabu Shabu – enoki, oden, different vegetables like cabbage and carrots to flavor the soup.
The prices here though are what really deserves a shout-out. On weekdays from 11.30am – 3pm, the 80 minutes buffet is as low as $14.90++ at I12 Katong Mall, and at $16.90++ at Plaza Singapura. Do note there’s an additional $3 fee on Fridays. Exclusively at I12 Katong mall, enjoy shabu shabu in a group of four and one dines free!
They have many outlets strewn across Singapore. East to west, from Bukit Panjang, Plaza Sing, Bugis + to Tampines mall, SUKI-YA  is the perfect place to arrange a catch up with friends over good old Shabu Shabu. The offers vary across different outlets, so do check out their promotions page for the most updated info.
Address: Refer here for a list of all their other outlets
4. SSIKKEK Korean BBQ
 
As per most Korean BBQs buffets in Singapore, you have a wide variety of meats with different cuts that range from pork collar, boneless chicken to marinated beef strips. A weekday lunch here is only at $14.90++.


Their cooked menu is limited to a few dishes like sweet potato, Topoki and onion pancakes but it doesn’t bother me much though. When it comes down to kBBQ, I am only in it for the meat so the limited cooked menu is fine.
They have 3 outlets in Singapore: United Square, Tanjong Pagar and Chinatown. They do not have a main website so you will have to google these individual outlets yourself. Also, check out their April promotion at the United Square outlet where weekend lunches are at $18/pax ++!
Address: 101 Thomson Road, Singapore 307591 (United Square Outlet) | 6254 8123 | Opening Hours for Lunch: 11:30am ~ 2:30pm (Daily Except PH) for Dinner: Sun ~ Thur, PH : 5:30pm ~ 12am Fri, Sat, Day Before PH : 5:30pm ~ 2am
5. House of Steamboat

Inside the store, there is a decent selection of yong tau fu items to choose from – Taupok, meatballs, fishballs, fish maw etc. It is in my personal opinion that most steamboat food usually tastes the same anyway so I am not too picky about food.
There is also an a la carte menu you order simple dishes like fried chicken drumlets, fried fish and mantous from. You can pay an extra $2 to have a grill for your food but I  don’t find it necessary. I like to come here for weekend dinners with old friends over steamboat.
At only $20nett per pax, you cannot find anything cheaper for a weekend buffet dinner. Don’t dress too nice if you’re paying the place a visit, everyone works up a little sweat during steamboat.
Address: 7 Tan Quee Lan St, Singapore 188096 | Tel number: +65 63362875 | Open daily from 12pm – 12am
6. Shabu Sai

Shabu Sai has seasonal soup broths from time to time. Like their Yuzu salt beauty ‘collagen’ soup in july last year. I always fall back on the Tonkotsu soup base anyway, it’s a safer option. They serve the usual Shabu Shabu, 3 meats with a healthy array of vegetables, sushi and ice-cream on the side for dessert.


With 6 outlets throughout Singapore mainly in central (Clarke Quay, Orchard Central,Suntec City) and the east (Changi City point, Eastpoint) with one outlet in the north (Causeway point), I recommend coming here for lunch on weekdays ($16.50++). The place still hits below the budget at $18.50++ on weekends too though.
Address: 181 Orchard Road, 08-09/10/11 Orchard Central, Singapore 238896 | Opening hours:  Mon – Fri: 11:00 – 15:00 and 18:00 – 22:00 Sat – Sun: 11:30 – 22:30 | Refer here for a full list of their other outlets mentioned earlier
7. Swensens Dessert Buffet (ION Orchard)
Photo: beverlys.com
Free flow waffles with brownies and cakes to pair with over 50 different ce cream types of your choice. The buffet runs 7 days a week and is exclusive to their Ion Orchard outlet. It does not come cheap though with the extended variety, the buffet is priced at $18.90 per pax. $12.90 if you get a main course separately before that.
I recommend this place only for the dessert junkie because only those with a sweet tooth can appreciate what they have here free flow. No where else can you get such an extensive range of gelato and ice cream with 40 types of toppings and a mix-in service too. Forget that silly Marble Slab Groupon deal, Swensen’s dessert buffet is the real deal.
Address: (Located inside Orchard Central) 2 Orchard Turn, #B1-31 | Tel: 68845967  | Opening hours: [Weekdays] 10.30am – 10.30pm [Weekends & PH] 8am-10.30pm
8. Kim Korean Zubir
 
A stone’s throw away from SOTA, the place is ridiculously priced at only $14++ on weekday lunches. Students have it even better with a special price at $12.90. At prices like these, I dare say it is one of the cheapest kBBQs in Singapore.
As per most Korean BBQ places, Kim Korean Zubir has the standard meat cuts with a cooked selection a tad bit more than Sikeiski. Dishes like fried chicken, ginseng soup, nuggets as a lead up to the Korean meats. There is only one drawback though, the place lacks smoke chimneys so you will stink a bit after the meal but at these prices I honestly could not care less.
Address: School Of The Arts Singapore, 1 Zubir Said Drive #01-04/07 Singapore 227968 (Dhoby Ghaut) | Tel: 6238 7218 | Opening hours: Mon – Fri: 11:30 – 14:30, Mon – Fri: 17:00 – 23:00 and Sat – Sun: 11:30 – 23:00
9. Lao Beijing
Photo: springtomorrow.com
While this buffet might be on the cheaper end ($13.99/pax during weekday High Tea) , the one caveat to it is the awkward eating timing from 3 – 5pm.  Have a heavy brunch before coming to Lao Beijing for your high tea. In the restaurant itself, a few simple dishes like fried noodles, custard buns (sadly not the runny type), siumai are laid out on the side.
The good stuff like the XLB, guotie, jiaozi are mostly on the paper menu. Its made this way so the dishes will always be served piping hot to customers. One of the cheapest deals in town, the limited variety of food items is very well worth overlooking for – What more can you ask for free flow XLBs at prices like these?

10. Ban Heng Harborfront center
Source: sparklette.com
Compared to Lao Beijing, the variety dim-sum wise is a lot more extensive. Of course, it is priced proportionally more too. At $19.30++ per pax, the buffet runs from 11.30am – 2.30pm everyday. They have the usual dim sum essentials like har-gow, prawn rolls, shrimp dumplings etc but as a disclaimer – no egg tarts.
The service here can be rather slow so try to order as many dishes as you can each time you send one order in. Do not make intermittent orders where you may have your order missed out. Sadly, this dim sum buffet is also only exclusive to their Harbourfront outlet. It’s available on weekends too so I wouldn’t mind making my way down for some good old (cheap) dim sum.
Note that it’s minimum of 4pax to enjoy the buffet.
Address: 1 Maritime Square #04-01 HarbourFront Centre 
Singapore 099253 | http://www.banheng.com.sg/habourfront-center/ | Opening hours: Lunch – 11:30am – 2:30pm Dinner – 6:00pm – 10:00pm 
11. King’s Laksa Steamboat

True to its name, this restaurant offers a wide enough variety of food befitting of a king’s feast. Unbelievable? I know. This restaurant boasts an array of over 80 steamboat ingredients that pairs wonderfully with their two soup bases; Laksa and Mala. 


In addition, the restaurant is situated in Serangoon that’s slightly detached from the general hustle and bustle of Central Singapore. Which ultimately makes it an ideal place to relax and hang out with your buddies.
Lunch: Mon-Fri steamboat buffet lunch $21.80++ per pax, from 11am – 2.59pm
King’s Laksa Steamboat: 17 Teck Chye Terrace, Singapore 545724 | Tel: +65 62878010 | Website
12. Chili Padi Nonya Cafe

If you’ve got a carving for Peranakan cuisine, the buffet offered by Chili Padi Nonya Cafe is as authentic as it gets around here.
Its buffet lunch is priced at ($18.80) available from Monday to Friday from 11.15am – 3pm and Buffet Hi-Tea at a ridiculously low price of ($12.80) available only on Weekends and Public Holidays from 3pm – 5.15pm.
Dive back into Singapore’s heritage with traditional Nonya cuisine such as Braised Nonya Chap Chye, Itek Sio, Ayam Bua Kuluak and not to mention their wealth of pastries as well! Also, they have catering services so do check that out as well.

14. Al Jasra Restaurant / Kasi Villa

Probably the cheapest Prata buffet around right now at only $6.90/person for 16 different prata flavours at Kasi Villa.
So if you’re broke and really hungry, you know where to go. BUT bring your friends because this is only applicable when there are at least 4 diners.
If however you can’t manage to find 4 people, Prata Corner/ Al Jasra also has a prata buffet promotion currently going at $7.90/person (U.P $9.90)

15. Crystal Cafe
Credit
A lesser known porridge buffet compared to Quality Cafe, Crystal Cafe deserves some attention too.
Considering the spread of dishes available including pastries and desserts, coffee and tea, the prices are pretty damn affordable.  Their Sweet Potato Porridge has received quite some praise.
Mon-Thurs(Lunch &Dinner), Friday (Lunch): $14.80++
Friday (Dinner), Sat-Sun, PH & PH eve: $16.80++
Lunch hours: 12PM-2:30PM, Dinner: 6-10PM
Orchard Grand Court, 131 Killiney Road, Singapore 239571 | Tel: 68302020 | Website
16. K.Cook Korean BBQ



Conveniently located in town with a view overlooking orchard and yet at a crazy affordable price.
When I go for Korean BBQ, the smell of the place tends to overwhelm me sometimes but at K.Cook, the place is spacious, with high ceilings and a big ass fan hence I assume the ventilation would be good.

Apart from the standard BBQ fare, they also offer cooked Korean dishes like Japchae, Pancake and Spicy Tofu Stew. To top this off with a cherry, you’d be happy to know that canned drinks and condiments are free flow.
You can literally feast till you conceive a food baby.
K.Cook is part of our 15 best Korean BBQ Restaurants. For more information, check out our review of K.Cook Korean BBQ here.
Buffet Lunch (Monday – Friday) $14.90++ from 11:30AM – 3PM

17. Goro Goro Steamboat & Korean Buffet
Credit


Other than usual ingredients for hotpot, they have Korean dises as well like Korean Chicken Wings, tteobokki, jjapchae etc.
They also have local foods like ngoh hiang, ee mee. For the buffet, one gets to choose 2 out of 6 soup bases – Mala, Beauty Collagen, Ginseng Chicken, Tom Yam, Tomato and Vegetable. Top up $5++ per table for an additional soup.
There are over 50 varieties of  meat, vegetables and common korean delicacies for weekday lunch, and up to 70 choices for dinner and weekend dining
Buffet Lunch – Monday – Friday $14.90++, Lunch hours: 11:30am – 2:30 PM. Their other timings are more than $20 but still pretty value for money, do check out the full price list on their website.

Editor’s End Note
Please do share any other cheap budget buffets you know below twenty dollars. It does not have to be from some mega chain outlet.  As long as its below the budget we would be more than happy to add it into this list! And if there are too many responses, we would probably start a whole new entry altogether.

As with every cheap budget buffet list article, there is always a catch. The prices here mostly do not include GST/service charge, so the total fee per pax might/will go above twenty dollars depending on the number of people you bring.This article works best to let you know exactly when and where to go to stretch your dollar.




Stop wasting your money on overpriced buffets that just aren’t worth it. If you have a craving and you want to satisfy it endlessly with just that without thinking about the price tag. You have come to the right place.  From Korean BBQs, Shabu Shabu to Dimsum budget buffets – In the words of Taylor Swift, “I could show you incredible things.”


1. Little Ice Cream Kafe (LICK)
 
The ice cream buffet here runs only on fridays from 2 – 4pm and 6 – 8pm. You are entitled to as many waffles as you would like with your gelato inclusive of toppings. The buffet procedure is rather simple; queue behind the counter and pick which flavors of ice cream you would like. Help yourself to the waffles at the side.
I recommend the Avocado gelato, they capture the natural buttery flavor perfectly without it being too sweet. Something most half-baked ice cream cafes compensate by drowning their ice cream with Gula Melaka. Pffft. Try their Kaya Ice cream here too, something I bet you’ve never seen anywhere else.
Address: 258 Tanjong Katong Road | http://lick.com.sg | Opening hours: Sun – Thu: 13:00 – 23:00 Fri – Sat: 11:00 – 00:00
2. KISEKI
 
$19.80++ for weekday lunches for free flow sashimi, chawamushi and fresh seafood. Kiseki is the Singapore standard to what a good buffet deal should be about. They have an extensive list of Japanese cuisine that includes yakitori, tempura and teppanyaki too.
Their dessert bar is pretty good too,  hosting a variety of cakes, mochi and gelatos with interesting flavors like yuzu and wasabi –  Kiseki never disappoints. As a tip, make a reservation before you come or risk waiting an entire hour to get in. I have tried too many times hoping otherwise and ended up with the dreaded wait.
Address: #08-01/02/03, Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road | Website| Opening hours: Daily 11:30 – 15:00 and 18:00 – 22:30 
3. SUKI-YA
 
I will be the first to say that SUKI-YA does not have an extensive selection. They have the right bases covered for a good Shabu Shabu – enoki, oden, different vegetables like cabbage and carrots to flavor the soup.
The prices here though are what really deserves a shout-out. On weekdays from 11.30am – 3pm, the 80 minutes buffet is as low as $14.90++ at I12 Katong Mall, and at $16.90++ at Plaza Singapura. Do note there’s an additional $3 fee on Fridays. Exclusively at I12 Katong mall, enjoy shabu shabu in a group of four and one dines free!
They have many outlets strewn across Singapore. East to west, from Bukit Panjang, Plaza Sing, Bugis + to Tampines mall, SUKI-YA  is the perfect place to arrange a catch up with friends over good old Shabu Shabu. The offers vary across different outlets, so do check out their promotions page for the most updated info.
Address: Refer here for a list of all their other outlets
4. SSIKKEK Korean BBQ
 
As per most Korean BBQs buffets in Singapore, you have a wide variety of meats with different cuts that range from pork collar, boneless chicken to marinated beef strips. A weekday lunch here is only at $14.90++.


Their cooked menu is limited to a few dishes like sweet potato, Topoki and onion pancakes but it doesn’t bother me much though. When it comes down to kBBQ, I am only in it for the meat so the limited cooked menu is fine.
They have 3 outlets in Singapore: United Square, Tanjong Pagar and Chinatown. They do not have a main website so you will have to google these individual outlets yourself. Also, check out their April promotion at the United Square outlet where weekend lunches are at $18/pax ++!
Address: 101 Thomson Road, Singapore 307591 (United Square Outlet) | 6254 8123 | Opening Hours for Lunch: 11:30am ~ 2:30pm (Daily Except PH) for Dinner: Sun ~ Thur, PH : 5:30pm ~ 12am Fri, Sat, Day Before PH : 5:30pm ~ 2am
5. House of Steamboat

Inside the store, there is a decent selection of yong tau fu items to choose from – Taupok, meatballs, fishballs, fish maw etc. It is in my personal opinion that most steamboat food usually tastes the same anyway so I am not too picky about food.
There is also an a la carte menu you order simple dishes like fried chicken drumlets, fried fish and mantous from. You can pay an extra $2 to have a grill for your food but I  don’t find it necessary. I like to come here for weekend dinners with old friends over steamboat.
At only $20nett per pax, you cannot find anything cheaper for a weekend buffet dinner. Don’t dress too nice if you’re paying the place a visit, everyone works up a little sweat during steamboat.
Address: 7 Tan Quee Lan St, Singapore 188096 | Tel number: +65 63362875 | Open daily from 12pm – 12am
6. Shabu Sai
Photo: sgfoodonfoot.com
Shabu Sai has seasonal soup broths from time to time. Like their Yuzu salt beauty ‘collagen’ soup in july last year. I always fall back on the Tonkotsu soup base anyway, it’s a safer option. They serve the usual Shabu Shabu, 3 meats with a healthy array of vegetables, sushi and ice-cream on the side for dessert.


With 6 outlets throughout Singapore mainly in central (Clarke Quay, Orchard Central,Suntec City) and the east (Changi City point, Eastpoint) with one outlet in the north (Causeway point), I recommend coming here for lunch on weekdays ($16.50++). The place still hits below the budget at $18.50++ on weekends too though.

7. Swensens Dessert Buffet (ION Orchard)
Photo: beverlys.com
Free flow waffles with brownies and cakes to pair with over 50 different ce cream types of your choice. The buffet runs 7 days a week and is exclusive to their Ion Orchard outlet. It does not come cheap though with the extended variety, the buffet is priced at $18.90 per pax. $12.90 if you get a main course separately before that.
I recommend this place only for the dessert junkie because only those with a sweet tooth can appreciate what they have here free flow. No where else can you get such an extensive range of gelato and ice cream with 40 types of toppings and a mix-in service too. Forget that silly Marble Slab Groupon deal, Swensen’s dessert buffet is the real deal.

8. Kim Korean Zubir
 
A stone’s throw away from SOTA, the place is ridiculously priced at only $14++ on weekday lunches. Students have it even better with a special price at $12.90. At prices like these, I dare say it is one of the cheapest kBBQs in Singapore.
As per most Korean BBQ places, Kim Korean Zubir has the standard meat cuts with a cooked selection a tad bit more than Sikeiski. Dishes like fried chicken, ginseng soup, nuggets as a lead up to the Korean meats. There is only one drawback though, the place lacks smoke chimneys so you will stink a bit after the meal but at these prices I honestly could not care less.
Address: School Of The Arts Singapore, 1 Zubir Said Drive #01-04/07 Singapore 227968 (Dhoby Ghaut) | Tel: 6238 7218 | Opening hours: Mon – Fri: 11:30 – 14:30, Mon – Fri: 17:00 – 23:00 and Sat – Sun: 11:30 – 23:00
9. Lao Beijing
Photo: springtomorrow.com
While this buffet might be on the cheaper end ($13.99/pax during weekday High Tea) , the one caveat to it is the awkward eating timing from 3 – 5pm.  Have a heavy brunch before coming to Lao Beijing for your high tea. In the restaurant itself, a few simple dishes like fried noodles, custard buns (sadly not the runny type), siumai are laid out on the side.
The good stuff like the XLB, guotie, jiaozi are mostly on the paper menu. Its made this way so the dishes will always be served piping hot to customers. One of the cheapest deals in town, the limited variety of food items is very well worth overlooking for – What more can you ask for free flow XLBs at prices like these?

10. Ban Heng Harborfront center
Source: sparklette.com
Compared to Lao Beijing, the variety dim-sum wise is a lot more extensive. Of course, it is priced proportionally more too. At $19.30++ per pax, the buffet runs from 11.30am – 2.30pm everyday. They have the usual dim sum essentials like har-gow, prawn rolls, shrimp dumplings etc but as a disclaimer – no egg tarts.
The service here can be rather slow so try to order as many dishes as you can each time you send one order in. Do not make intermittent orders where you may have your order missed out. Sadly, this dim sum buffet is also only exclusive to their Harbourfront outlet. It’s available on weekends too so I wouldn’t mind making my way down for some good old (cheap) dim sum.
Note that it’s minimum of 4pax to enjoy the buffet.

True to its name, this restaurant offers a wide enough variety of food befitting of a king’s feast. Unbelievable? I know. This restaurant boasts an array of over 80 steamboat ingredients that pairs wonderfully with their two soup bases; Laksa and Mala. 


In addition, the restaurant is situated in Serangoon that’s slightly detached from the general hustle and bustle of Central Singapore. Which ultimately makes it an ideal place to relax and hang out with your buddies.
Lunch: Mon-Fri steamboat buffet lunch $21.80++ per pax, from 11am – 2.59pm

12. Chili Padi Nonya Cafe

If you’ve got a carving for Peranakan cuisine, the buffet offered by Chili Padi Nonya Cafe is as authentic as it gets around here.
Its buffet lunch is priced at ($18.80) available from Monday to Friday from 11.15am – 3pm and Buffet Hi-Tea at a ridiculously low price of ($12.80) available only on Weekends and Public Holidays from 3pm – 5.15pm.
Dive back into Singapore’s heritage with traditional Nonya cuisine such as Braised Nonya Chap Chye, Itek Sio, Ayam Bua Kuluak and not to mention their wealth of pastries as well! Also, they have catering services so do check that out as well.

14. Al Jasra Restaurant / Kasi Villa

Probably the cheapest Prata buffet around right now at only $6.90/person for 16 different prata flavours at Kasi Villa.
So if you’re broke and really hungry, you know where to go. BUT bring your friends because this is only applicable when there are at least 4 diners.
If however you can’t manage to find 4 people, Prata Corner/ Al Jasra also has a prata buffet promotion currently going at $7.90/person (U.P $9.90)

15. Crystal Cafe

A lesser known porridge buffet compared to Quality Cafe, Crystal Cafe deserves some attention too.
Considering the spread of dishes available including pastries and desserts, coffee and tea, the prices are pretty damn affordable.  Their Sweet Potato Porridge has received quite some praise.
Mon-Thurs(Lunch &Dinner), Friday (Lunch): $14.80++
Friday (Dinner), Sat-Sun, PH & PH eve: $16.80++
Lunch hours: 12PM-2:30PM, Dinner: 6-10PM

16. K.Cook Korean BBQ



Conveniently located in town with a view overlooking orchard and yet at a crazy affordable price.
When I go for Korean BBQ, the smell of the place tends to overwhelm me sometimes but at K.Cook, the place is spacious, with high ceilings and a big ass fan hence I assume the ventilation would be good.

Apart from the standard BBQ fare, they also offer cooked Korean dishes like Japchae, Pancake and Spicy Tofu Stew. To top this off with a cherry, you’d be happy to know that canned drinks and condiments are free flow.
You can literally feast till you conceive a food baby.
K.Cook is part of our 15 best Korean BBQ Restaurants. For more information, check out our review of K.Cook Korean BBQ here.
Buffet Lunch (Monday – Friday) $14.90++ from 11:30AM – 3PM

Other than usual ingredients for hotpot, they have Korean dises as well like Korean Chicken Wings, tteobokki, jjapchae etc.
They also have local foods like ngoh hiang, ee mee. For the buffet, one gets to choose 2 out of 6 soup bases – Mala, Beauty Collagen, Ginseng Chicken, Tom Yam, Tomato and Vegetable. Top up $5++ per table for an additional soup.
There are over 50 varieties of  meat, vegetables and common korean delicacies for weekday lunch, and up to 70 choices for dinner and weekend dining
Buffet Lunch – Monday – Friday $14.90++, Lunch hours: 11:30am – 2:30 PM. Their other timings are more than $20 but still pretty value for money, do check out the full price list on their website.

Please do share any other cheap budget buffets you know below twenty dollars. It does not have to be from some mega chain outlet.  As long as its below the budget we would be more than happy to add it into this list! And if there are too many responses, we would probably start a whole new entry altogether.

As with every cheap budget buffet list article, there is always a catch. The prices here mostly do not include GST/service charge, so the total fee per pax might/will go above twenty dollars depending on the number of people you bring.This article works best to let you know exactly when and where to go to stretch your dollar.




Stop wasting your money on overpriced buffets that just aren’t worth it. If you have a craving and you want to satisfy it endlessly with just that without thinking about the price tag. You have come to the right place.  From Korean BBQs, Shabu Shabu to Dimsum budget buffets – In the words of Taylor Swift, “I could show you incredible things.”


1. Little Ice Cream Kafe (LICK)
 
The ice cream buffet here runs only on fridays from 2 – 4pm and 6 – 8pm. You are entitled to as many waffles as you would like with your gelato inclusive of toppings. The buffet procedure is rather simple; queue behind the counter and pick which flavors of ice cream you would like. Help yourself to the waffles at the side.
I recommend the Avocado gelato, they capture the natural buttery flavor perfectly without it being too sweet. Something most half-baked ice cream cafes compensate by drowning their ice cream with Gula Melaka. Pffft. Try their Kaya Ice cream here too, something I bet you’ve never seen anywhere else.
Address: 258 Tanjong Katong Road | http://lick.com.sg | Opening hours: Sun – Thu: 13:00 – 23:00 Fri – Sat: 11:00 – 00:00
2. KISEKI
 
$19.80++ for weekday lunches for free flow sashimi, chawamushi and fresh seafood. Kiseki is the Singapore standard to what a good buffet deal should be about. They have an extensive list of Japanese cuisine that includes yakitori, tempura and teppanyaki too.
Their dessert bar is pretty good too,  hosting a variety of cakes, mochi and gelatos with interesting flavors like yuzu and wasabi –  Kiseki never disappoints. As a tip, make a reservation before you come or risk waiting an entire hour to get in. I have tried too many times hoping otherwise and ended up with the dreaded wait.
Address: #08-01/02/03, Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road | Website| Opening hours: Daily 11:30 – 15:00 and 18:00 – 22:30 
3. SUKI-YA
 
I will be the first to say that SUKI-YA does not have an extensive selection. They have the right bases covered for a good Shabu Shabu – enoki, oden, different vegetables like cabbage and carrots to flavor the soup.
The prices here though are what really deserves a shout-out. On weekdays from 11.30am – 3pm, the 80 minutes buffet is as low as $14.90++ at I12 Katong Mall, and at $16.90++ at Plaza Singapura. Do note there’s an additional $3 fee on Fridays. Exclusively at I12 Katong mall, enjoy shabu shabu in a group of four and one dines free!
They have many outlets strewn across Singapore. East to west, from Bukit Panjang, Plaza Sing, Bugis + to Tampines mall, SUKI-YA  is the perfect place to arrange a catch up with friends over good old Shabu Shabu. The offers vary across different outlets, so do check out their promotions page for the most updated info.
Address: Refer here for a list of all their other outlets
4. SSIKKEK Korean BBQ
 
As per most Korean BBQs buffets in Singapore, you have a wide variety of meats with different cuts that range from pork collar, boneless chicken to marinated beef strips. A weekday lunch here is only at $14.90++.


Their cooked menu is limited to a few dishes like sweet potato, Topoki and onion pancakes but it doesn’t bother me much though. When it comes down to kBBQ, I am only in it for the meat so the limited cooked menu is fine.
They have 3 outlets in Singapore: United Square, Tanjong Pagar and Chinatown. They do not have a main website so you will have to google these individual outlets yourself. Also, check out their April promotion at the United Square outlet where weekend lunches are at $18/pax ++!
Address: 101 Thomson Road, Singapore 307591 (United Square Outlet) | 6254 8123 | Opening Hours for Lunch: 11:30am ~ 2:30pm (Daily Except PH) for Dinner: Sun ~ Thur, PH : 5:30pm ~ 12am Fri, Sat, Day Before PH : 5:30pm ~ 2am
5. House of Steamboat

Inside the store, there is a decent selection of yong tau fu items to choose from – Taupok, meatballs, fishballs, fish maw etc. It is in my personal opinion that most steamboat food usually tastes the same anyway so I am not too picky about food.
There is also an a la carte menu you order simple dishes like fried chicken drumlets, fried fish and mantous from. You can pay an extra $2 to have a grill for your food but I  don’t find it necessary. I like to come here for weekend dinners with old friends over steamboat.
At only $20nett per pax, you cannot find anything cheaper for a weekend buffet dinner. Don’t dress too nice if you’re paying the place a visit, everyone works up a little sweat during steamboat.
Address: 7 Tan Quee Lan St, Singapore 188096 | Tel number: +65 63362875 | Open daily from 12pm – 12am
6. Shabu Sai
Photo: sgfoodonfoot.com
Shabu Sai has seasonal soup broths from time to time. Like their Yuzu salt beauty ‘collagen’ soup in july last year. I always fall back on the Tonkotsu soup base anyway, it’s a safer option. They serve the usual Shabu Shabu, 3 meats with a healthy array of vegetables, sushi and ice-cream on the side for dessert.


With 6 outlets throughout Singapore mainly in central (Clarke Quay, Orchard Central,Suntec City) and the east (Changi City point, Eastpoint) with one outlet in the north (Causeway point), I recommend coming here for lunch on weekdays ($16.50++). The place still hits below the budget at $18.50++ on weekends too though.
Address: 181 Orchard Road, 08-09/10/11 Orchard Central, Singapore 238896 | Opening hours:  Mon – Fri: 11:00 – 15:00 and 18:00 – 22:00 Sat – Sun: 11:30 – 22:30 | Refer here for a full list of their other outlets mentioned earlier

As with every cheap budget buffet list article, there is always a catch. The prices here mostly do not include GST/service charge, so the total fee per pax might/will go above twenty dollars depending on the number of people you bring.This article works best to let you know exactly when and where to go to stretch your dollar.




Stop wasting your money on overpriced buffets that just aren’t worth it. If you have a craving and you want to satisfy it endlessly with just that without thinking about the price tag. You have come to the right place.  From Korean BBQs, Shabu Shabu to Dimsum budget buffets – In the words of Taylor Swift, “I could show you incredible things.”


1. Little Ice Cream Kafe (LICK)
 
The ice cream buffet here runs only on fridays from 2 – 4pm and 6 – 8pm. You are entitled to as many waffles as you would like with your gelato inclusive of toppings. The buffet procedure is rather simple; queue behind the counter and pick which flavors of ice cream you would like. Help yourself to the waffles at the side.
I recommend the Avocado gelato, they capture the natural buttery flavor perfectly without it being too sweet. Something most half-baked ice cream cafes compensate by drowning their ice cream with Gula Melaka. Pffft. Try their Kaya Ice cream here too, something I bet you’ve never seen anywhere else.
Address: 258 Tanjong Katong Road | http://lick.com.sg | Opening hours: Sun – Thu: 13:00 – 23:00 Fri – Sat: 11:00 – 00:00
2. KISEKI
 
$19.80++ for weekday lunches for free flow sashimi, chawamushi and fresh seafood. Kiseki is the Singapore standard to what a good buffet deal should be about. They have an extensive list of Japanese cuisine that includes yakitori, tempura and teppanyaki too.
Their dessert bar is pretty good too,  hosting a variety of cakes, mochi and gelatos with interesting flavors like yuzu and wasabi –  Kiseki never disappoints. As a tip, make a reservation before you come or risk waiting an entire hour to get in. I have tried too many times hoping otherwise and ended up with the dreaded wait.
Address: #08-01/02/03, Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road | Website| Opening hours: Daily 11:30 – 15:00 and 18:00 – 22:30 
3. SUKI-YA
 
I will be the first to say that SUKI-YA does not have an extensive selection. They have the right bases covered for a good Shabu Shabu – enoki, oden, different vegetables like cabbage and carrots to flavor the soup.
The prices here though are what really deserves a shout-out. On weekdays from 11.30am – 3pm, the 80 minutes buffet is as low as $14.90++ at I12 Katong Mall, and at $16.90++ at Plaza Singapura. Do note there’s an additional $3 fee on Fridays. Exclusively at I12 Katong mall, enjoy shabu shabu in a group of four and one dines free!
They have many outlets strewn across Singapore. East to west, from Bukit Panjang, Plaza Sing, Bugis + to Tampines mall, SUKI-YA  is the perfect place to arrange a catch up with friends over good old Shabu Shabu. The offers vary across different outlets, so do check out their promotions page for the most updated info.
Address: Refer here for a list of all their other outlets
4. SSIKKEK Korean BBQ
 
As per most Korean BBQs buffets in Singapore, you have a wide variety of meats with different cuts that range from pork collar, boneless chicken to marinated beef strips. A weekday lunch here is only at $14.90++.


Their cooked menu is limited to a few dishes like sweet potato, Topoki and onion pancakes but it doesn’t bother me much though. When it comes down to kBBQ, I am only in it for the meat so the limited cooked menu is fine.
They have 3 outlets in Singapore: United Square, Tanjong Pagar and Chinatown. They do not have a main website so you will have to google these individual outlets yourself. Also, check out their April promotion at the United Square outlet where weekend lunches are at $18/pax ++!
Address: 101 Thomson Road, Singapore 307591 (United Square Outlet) | 6254 8123 | Opening Hours for Lunch: 11:30am ~ 2:30pm (Daily Except PH) for Dinner: Sun ~ Thur, PH : 5:30pm ~ 12am Fri, Sat, Day Before PH : 5:30pm ~ 2am
5. House of Steamboat

Inside the store, there is a decent selection of yong tau fu items to choose from – Taupok, meatballs, fishballs, fish maw etc. It is in my personal opinion that most steamboat food usually tastes the same anyway so I am not too picky about food.
There is also an a la carte menu you order simple dishes like fried chicken drumlets, fried fish and mantous from. You can pay an extra $2 to have a grill for your food but I  don’t find it necessary. I like to come here for weekend dinners with old friends over steamboat.
At only $20nett per pax, you cannot find anything cheaper for a weekend buffet dinner. Don’t dress too nice if you’re paying the place a visit, everyone works up a little sweat during steamboat.
Address: 7 Tan Quee Lan St, Singapore 188096 | Tel number: +65 63362875 | Open daily from 12pm – 12am
6. Shabu Sai
Photo: sgfoodonfoot.com
Shabu Sai has seasonal soup broths from time to time. Like their Yuzu salt beauty ‘collagen’ soup in july last year. I always fall back on the Tonkotsu soup base anyway, it’s a safer option. They serve the usual Shabu Shabu, 3 meats with a healthy array of vegetables, sushi and ice-cream on the side for dessert.


With 6 outlets throughout Singapore mainly in central (Clarke Quay, Orchard Central,Suntec City) and the east (Changi City point, Eastpoint) with one outlet in the north (Causeway point), I recommend coming here for lunch on weekdays ($16.50++). The place still hits below the budget at $18.50++ on weekends too though.
Address: 181 Orchard Road, 08-09/10/11 Orchard Central, Singapore 238896 | Opening hours:  Mon – Fri: 11:00 – 15:00 and 18:00 – 22:00 Sat – Sun: 11:30 – 22:30 | Refer here for a full list of their other outlets mentioned earlier
7. Swensens Dessert Buffet (ION Orchard)
Photo: beverlys.com
Free flow waffles with brownies and cakes to pair with over 50 different ce cream types of your choice. The buffet runs 7 days a week and is exclusive to their Ion Orchard outlet. It does not come cheap though with the extended variety, the buffet is priced at $18.90 per pax. $12.90 if you get a main course separately before that.
I recommend this place only for the dessert junkie because only those with a sweet tooth can appreciate what they have here free flow. No where else can you get such an extensive range of gelato and ice cream with 40 types of toppings and a mix-in service too. Forget that silly Marble Slab Groupon deal, Swensen’s dessert buffet is the real deal.
Address: (Located inside Orchard Central) 2 Orchard Turn, #B1-31 | Tel: 68845967  | Opening hours: [Weekdays] 10.30am – 10.30pm [Weekends & PH] 8am-10.30pm
8. Kim Korean Zubir
 
A stone’s throw away from SOTA, the place is ridiculously priced at only $14++ on weekday lunches. Students have it even better with a special price at $12.90. At prices like these, I dare say it is one of the cheapest kBBQs in Singapore.
As per most Korean BBQ places, Kim Korean Zubir has the standard meat cuts with a cooked selection a tad bit more than Sikeiski. Dishes like fried chicken, ginseng soup, nuggets as a lead up to the Korean meats. There is only one drawback though, the place lacks smoke chimneys so you will stink a bit after the meal but at these prices I honestly could not care less.
Address: School Of The Arts Singapore, 1 Zubir Said Drive #01-04/07 Singapore 227968 (Dhoby Ghaut) | Tel: 6238 7218 | Opening hours: Mon – Fri: 11:30 – 14:30, Mon – Fri: 17:00 – 23:00 and Sat – Sun: 11:30 – 23:00
9. Lao Beijing
Photo: springtomorrow.com
While this buffet might be on the cheaper end ($13.99/pax during weekday High Tea) , the one caveat to it is the awkward eating timing from 3 – 5pm.  Have a heavy brunch before coming to Lao Beijing for your high tea. In the restaurant itself, a few simple dishes like fried noodles, custard buns (sadly not the runny type), siumai are laid out on the side.
The good stuff like the XLB, guotie, jiaozi are mostly on the paper menu. Its made this way so the dishes will always be served piping hot to customers. One of the cheapest deals in town, the limited variety of food items is very well worth overlooking for – What more can you ask for free flow XLBs at prices like these?

10. Ban Heng Harborfront center
Source: sparklette.com
Compared to Lao Beijing, the variety dim-sum wise is a lot more extensive. Of course, it is priced proportionally more too. At $19.30++ per pax, the buffet runs from 11.30am – 2.30pm everyday. They have the usual dim sum essentials like har-gow, prawn rolls, shrimp dumplings etc but as a disclaimer – no egg tarts.
The service here can be rather slow so try to order as many dishes as you can each time you send one order in. Do not make intermittent orders where you may have your order missed out. Sadly, this dim sum buffet is also only exclusive to their Harbourfront outlet. It’s available on weekends too so I wouldn’t mind making my way down for some good old (cheap) dim sum.
Note that it’s minimum of 4pax to enjoy the buffet.
Address: 1 Maritime Square #04-01 HarbourFront Centre

11. King’s Laksa Steamboat
Credit


True to its name, this restaurant offers a wide enough variety of food befitting of a king’s feast. Unbelievable? I know. This restaurant boasts an array of over 80 steamboat ingredients that pairs wonderfully with their two soup bases; Laksa and Mala. 


In addition, the restaurant is situated in Serangoon that’s slightly detached from the general hustle and bustle of Central Singapore. Which ultimately makes it an ideal place to relax and hang out with your buddies.
Lunch: Mon-Fri steamboat buffet lunch $21.80++ per pax, from 11am – 2.59pm

12. Chili Padi Nonya Cafe

If you’ve got a carving for Peranakan cuisine, the buffet offered by Chili Padi Nonya Cafe is as authentic as it gets around here.
Its buffet lunch is priced at ($18.80) available from Monday to Friday from 11.15am – 3pm and Buffet Hi-Tea at a ridiculously low price of ($12.80) available only on Weekends and Public Holidays from 3pm – 5.15pm.
Dive back into Singapore’s heritage with traditional Nonya cuisine such as Braised Nonya Chap Chye, Itek Sio, Ayam Bua Kuluak and not to mention their wealth of pastries as well! Also, they have catering services so do check that out as well.

14. Al Jasra Restaurant / Kasi Villa

Probably the cheapest Prata buffet around right now at only $6.90/person for 16 different prata flavours at Kasi Villa.
So if you’re broke and really hungry, you know where to go. BUT bring your friends because this is only applicable when there are at least 4 diners.
If however you can’t manage to find 4 people, Prata Corner/ Al Jasra also has a prata buffet promotion currently going at $7.90/person (U.P $9.90)

15. Crystal Cafe

A lesser known porridge buffet compared to Quality Cafe, Crystal Cafe deserves some attention too.
Considering the spread of dishes available including pastries and desserts, coffee and tea, the prices are pretty damn affordable.  Their Sweet Potato Porridge has received quite some praise.
Mon-Thurs(Lunch &Dinner), Friday (Lunch): $14.80++
Friday (Dinner), Sat-Sun, PH & PH eve: $16.80++
Lunch hours: 12PM-2:30PM, Dinner: 6-10PM

16. K.Cook Korean BBQ



Conveniently located in town with a view overlooking orchard and yet at a crazy affordable price.
When I go for Korean BBQ, the smell of the place tends to overwhelm me sometimes but at K.Cook, the place is spacious, with high ceilings and a big ass fan hence I assume the ventilation would be good.

Apart from the standard BBQ fare, they also offer cooked Korean dishes like Japchae, Pancake and Spicy Tofu Stew. To top this off with a cherry, you’d be happy to know that canned drinks and condiments are free flow.
You can literally feast till you conceive a food baby.
K.Cook is part of our 15 best Korean BBQ Restaurants. For more information, check out our review of K.Cook Korean BBQ here.
Buffet Lunch (Monday – Friday) $14.90++ from 11:30AM – 3PM

17. Goro Goro Steamboat & Korean Buffet

Other than usual ingredients for hotpot, they have Korean dises as well like Korean Chicken Wings, tteobokki, jjapchae etc.
They also have local foods like ngoh hiang, ee mee. For the buffet, one gets to choose 2 out of 6 soup bases – Mala, Beauty Collagen, Ginseng Chicken, Tom Yam, Tomato and Vegetable. Top up $5++ per table for an additional soup.
There are over 50 varieties of  meat, vegetables and common korean delicacies for weekday lunch, and up to 70 choices for dinner and weekend dining
Buffet Lunch – Monday – Friday $14.90++, Lunch hours: 11:30am – 2:30 PM. Their other timings are more than $20 but still pretty value for money, do check out the full price list on their website.

Editor’s End Note
Please do share any other cheap budget buffets you know below twenty dollars. It does not have to be from some mega chain outlet.  As long as its below the budget we would be more than happy to add it into this list! And if there are too many responses, we would probably start a whole new entry altogether.

As with every cheap budget buffet list article, there is always a catch. The prices here mostly do not include GST/service charge, so the total fee per pax might/will go above twenty dollars depending on the number of people you bring.This article works best to let you know exactly when and where to go to stretch your dollar.




Stop wasting your money on overpriced buffets that just aren’t worth it. If you have a craving and you want to satisfy it endlessly with just that without thinking about the price tag. You have come to the right place.  From Korean BBQs, Shabu Shabu to Dimsum budget buffets – In the words of Taylor Swift, “I could show you incredible things.”


1. Little Ice Cream Kafe (LICK)
 
The ice cream buffet here runs only on fridays from 2 – 4pm and 6 – 8pm. You are entitled to as many waffles as you would like with your gelato inclusive of toppings. The buffet procedure is rather simple; queue behind the counter and pick which flavors of ice cream you would like. Help yourself to the waffles at the side.
I recommend the Avocado gelato, they capture the natural buttery flavor perfectly without it being too sweet. Something most half-baked ice cream cafes compensate by drowning their ice cream with Gula Melaka. Pffft. Try their Kaya Ice cream here too, something I bet you’ve never seen anywhere else.
Address: 258 Tanjong Katong Road | http://lick.com.sg | Opening hours: Sun – Thu: 13:00 – 23:00 Fri – Sat: 11:00 – 00:00
2. KISEKI
 
$19.80++ for weekday lunches for free flow sashimi, chawamushi and fresh seafood. Kiseki is the Singapore standard to what a good buffet deal should be about. They have an extensive list of Japanese cuisine that includes yakitori, tempura and teppanyaki too.
Their dessert bar is pretty good too,  hosting a variety of cakes, mochi and gelatos with interesting flavors like yuzu and wasabi –  Kiseki never disappoints. As a tip, make a reservation before you come or risk waiting an entire hour to get in. I have tried too many times hoping otherwise and ended up with the dreaded wait.
Address: #08-01/02/03, Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road | Website| Opening hours: Daily 11:30 – 15:00 and 18:00 – 22:30 
3. SUKI-YA
 
I will be the first to say that SUKI-YA does not have an extensive selection. They have the right bases covered for a good Shabu Shabu – enoki, oden, different vegetables like cabbage and carrots to flavor the soup.
The prices here though are what really deserves a shout-out. On weekdays from 11.30am – 3pm, the 80 minutes buffet is as low as $14.90++ at I12 Katong Mall, and at $16.90++ at Plaza Singapura. Do note there’s an additional $3 fee on Fridays. Exclusively at I12 Katong mall, enjoy shabu shabu in a group of four and one dines free!
They have many outlets strewn across Singapore. East to west, from Bukit Panjang, Plaza Sing, Bugis + to Tampines mall, SUKI-YA  is the perfect place to arrange a catch up with friends over good old Shabu Shabu. The offers vary across different outlets, so do check out their promotions page for the most updated info.
Address: Refer here for a list of all their other outlets
4. SSIKKEK Korean BBQ
 
As per most Korean BBQs buffets in Singapore, you have a wide variety of meats with different cuts that range from pork collar, boneless chicken to marinated beef strips. A weekday lunch here is only at $14.90++.


Their cooked menu is limited to a few dishes like sweet potato, Topoki and onion pancakes but it doesn’t bother me much though. When it comes down to kBBQ, I am only in it for the meat so the limited cooked menu is fine.
They have 3 outlets in Singapore: United Square, Tanjong Pagar and Chinatown. They do not have a main website so you will have to google these individual outlets yourself. Also, check out their April promotion at the United Square outlet where weekend lunches are at $18/pax ++!
Address: 101 Thomson Road, Singapore 307591 (United Square Outlet) | 6254 8123 | Opening Hours for Lunch: 11:30am ~ 2:30pm (Daily Except PH) for Dinner: Sun ~ Thur, PH : 5:30pm ~ 12am Fri, Sat, Day Before PH : 5:30pm ~ 2am
5. House of Steamboat

Inside the store, there is a decent selection of yong tau fu items to choose from – Taupok, meatballs, fishballs, fish maw etc. It is in my personal opinion that most steamboat food usually tastes the same anyway so I am not too picky about food.
There is also an a la carte menu you order simple dishes like fried chicken drumlets, fried fish and mantous from. You can pay an extra $2 to have a grill for your food but I  don’t find it necessary. I like to come here for weekend dinners with old friends over steamboat.
At only $20nett per pax, you cannot find anything cheaper for a weekend buffet dinner. Don’t dress too nice if you’re paying the place a visit, everyone works up a little sweat during steamboat.

6. Shabu Sai

Shabu Sai has seasonal soup broths from time to time. Like their Yuzu salt beauty ‘collagen’ soup in july last year. I always fall back on the Tonkotsu soup base anyway, it’s a safer option. They serve the usual Shabu Shabu, 3 meats with a healthy array of vegetables, sushi and ice-cream on the side for dessert.


With 6 outlets throughout Singapore mainly in central (Clarke Quay, Orchard Central,Suntec City) and the east (Changi City point, Eastpoint) with one outlet in the north (Causeway point), I recommend coming here for lunch on weekdays ($16.50++). The place still hits below the budget at $18.50++ on weekends too though.
Address: 181 Orchard Road, 08-09/10/11 Orchard Central, Singapore 238896 | Opening hours:  Mon – Fri: 11:00 – 15:00 and 18:00 – 22:00 Sat – Sun: 11:30 – 22:30 | Refer here for a full list of their other outlets mentioned earlier
7. Swensens Dessert Buffet (ION Orchard)
Photo: beverlys.com
Free flow waffles with brownies and cakes to pair with over 50 different ce cream types of your choice. The buffet runs 7 days a week and is exclusive to their Ion Orchard outlet. It does not come cheap though with the extended variety, the buffet is priced at $18.90 per pax. $12.90 if you get a main course separately before that.
I recommend this place only for the dessert junkie because only those with a sweet tooth can appreciate what they have here free flow. No where else can you get such an extensive range of gelato and ice cream with 40 types of toppings and a mix-in service too. Forget that silly Marble Slab Groupon deal, Swensen’s dessert buffet is the real deal.
Address: (Located inside Orchard Central) 2 Orchard Turn, #B1-31 | Tel: 68845967  | Opening hours: [Weekdays] 10.30am – 10.30pm [Weekends & PH] 8am-10.30pm
8. Kim Korean Zubir
 
A stone’s throw away from SOTA, the place is ridiculously priced at only $14++ on weekday lunches. Students have it even better with a special price at $12.90. At prices like these, I dare say it is one of the cheapest kBBQs in Singapore.
As per most Korean BBQ places, Kim Korean Zubir has the standard meat cuts with a cooked selection a tad bit more than Sikeiski. Dishes like fried chicken, ginseng soup, nuggets as a lead up to the Korean meats. There is only one drawback though, the place lacks smoke chimneys so you will stink a bit after the meal but at these prices I honestly could not care less.
Address: School Of The Arts Singapore, 1 Zubir Said Drive #01-04/07 Singapore 227968 (Dhoby Ghaut) | Tel: 6238 7218 | Opening hours: Mon – Fri: 11:30 – 14:30, Mon – Fri: 17:00 – 23:00 and Sat – Sun: 11:30 – 23:00
9. Lao Beijing
Photo: springtomorrow.com
While this buffet might be on the cheaper end ($13.99/pax during weekday High Tea) , the one caveat to it is the awkward eating timing from 3 – 5pm.  Have a heavy brunch before coming to Lao Beijing for your high tea. In the restaurant itself, a few simple dishes like fried noodles, custard buns (sadly not the runny type), siumai are laid out on the side.
The good stuff like the XLB, guotie, jiaozi are mostly on the paper menu. Its made this way so the dishes will always be served piping hot to customers. One of the cheapest deals in town, the limited variety of food items is very well worth overlooking for – What more can you ask for free flow XLBs at prices like these?

10. Ban Heng Harborfront center
Source: sparklette.com
Compared to Lao Beijing, the variety dim-sum wise is a lot more extensive. Of course, it is priced proportionally more too. At $19.30++ per pax, the buffet runs from 11.30am – 2.30pm everyday. They have the usual dim sum essentials like har-gow, prawn rolls, shrimp dumplings etc but as a disclaimer – no egg tarts.
The service here can be rather slow so try to order as many dishes as you can each time you send one order in. Do not make intermittent orders where you may have your order missed out. Sadly, this dim sum buffet is also only exclusive to their Harbourfront outlet. It’s available on weekends too so I wouldn’t mind making my way down for some good old (cheap) dim sum.
Note that it’s minimum of 4pax to enjoy the buffet.

11. King’s Laksa Steamboat
Credit


True to its name, this restaurant offers a wide enough variety of food befitting of a king’s feast. Unbelievable? I know. This restaurant boasts an array of over 80 steamboat ingredients that pairs wonderfully with their two soup bases; Laksa and Mala. 


In addition, the restaurant is situated in Serangoon that’s slightly detached from the general hustle and bustle of Central Singapore. Which ultimately makes it an ideal place to relax and hang out with your buddies.
Lunch: Mon-Fri steamboat buffet lunch $21.80++ per pax, from 11am – 2.59pm

12. Chili Padi Nonya Cafe

If you’ve got a carving for Peranakan cuisine, the buffet offered by Chili Padi Nonya Cafe is as authentic as it gets around here.
Its buffet lunch is priced at ($18.80) available from Monday to Friday from 11.15am – 3pm and Buffet Hi-Tea at a ridiculously low price of ($12.80) available only on Weekends and Public Holidays from 3pm – 5.15pm.
Dive back into Singapore’s heritage with traditional Nonya cuisine such as Braised Nonya Chap Chye, Itek Sio, Ayam Bua Kuluak and not to mention their wealth of pastries as well! Also, they have catering services so do check that out as well.

14. Al Jasra Restaurant / Kasi Villa

Probably the cheapest Prata buffet around right now at only $6.90/person for 16 different prata flavours at Kasi Villa.
So if you’re broke and really hungry, you know where to go. BUT bring your friends because this is only applicable when there are at least 4 diners.
If however you can’t manage to find 4 people, Prata Corner/ Al Jasra also has a prata buffet promotion currently going at $7.90/person (U.P $9.90)

15. Crystal Cafe

A lesser known porridge buffet compared to Quality Cafe, Crystal Cafe deserves some attention too.
Considering the spread of dishes available including pastries and desserts, coffee and tea, the prices are pretty damn affordable.  Their Sweet Potato Porridge has received quite some praise.
Mon-Thurs(Lunch &Dinner), Friday (Lunch): $14.80++

16. K.Cook Korean BBQ



Conveniently located in town with a view overlooking orchard and yet at a crazy affordable price.
When I go for Korean BBQ, the smell of the place tends to overwhelm me sometimes but at K.Cook, the place is spacious, with high ceilings and a big ass fan hence I assume the ventilation would be good.

Apart from the standard BBQ fare, they also offer cooked Korean dishes like Japchae, Pancake and Spicy Tofu Stew. To top this off with a cherry, you’d be happy to know that canned drinks and condiments are free flow.
You can literally feast till you conceive a food baby.
K.Cook is part of our 15 best Korean BBQ Restaurants. For more information, check out our review of K.Cook Korean BBQ here.
Buffet Lunch (Monday – Friday) $14.90++ from 11:30AM – 3PM

Editor’s End Note
Please do share any other cheap budget buffets you know below twenty dollars. It does not have to be from some mega chain outlet.  As long as its below the budget we would be more than happy to add it into this list! And if there are too many responses, we would probably start a whole new entry altogether.
