Singapore $20 and Below Last Updated: January 23, 2018 Written by Marshall Too Shares Affordable Buffets Written By Marshall Too Categories Affordable Buffets Shares 16.1kSHARESShareTweetFree Restaurant Voucher As with every cheap budget buffet list article, there is always a catch. The prices here mostly do not include GST/service charge, so the total fee per pax might/will go above twenty dollars depending on the number of people you bring.This article works best to let you know exactly when and where to go to stretch your dollar. Stop wasting your money on overpriced buffets that just aren\\u2019t worth it. If you have a craving and you want to satisfy it endlessly with just that without thinking about the price tag. You have come to the right place. From Korean BBQs, Shabu Shabu to Dimsum budget buffets \\u2013 In the words of Taylor Swift, \\u201cI could show you incredible things.\\u201d 1. Little Ice Cream Kafe (LICK) The ice cream buffet here runs only on fridays from 2 \\u2013 4pm and 6 \\u2013 8pm. You are entitled to as many waffles as you would like with your gelato inclusive of toppings. The buffet procedure is rather simple; queue behind the counter and pick which flavors of ice cream you would like. Help yourself to the waffles at the side. I recommend the Avocado gelato, they capture the natural buttery flavor perfectly without it being too sweet. Something most half-baked ice cream cafes compensate by drowning their ice cream with Gula Melaka. Pffft. Try their Kaya Ice cream here too, something I bet you\\u2019ve never seen anywhere else. Address: 258 Tanjong Katong Road | http://lick.com.sg | Opening hours: Sun \\u2013 Thu: 13:00 \\u2013 23:00 Fri \\u2013 Sat: 11:00 \\u2013 00:00 2. KISEKI $19.80++ for weekday lunches for free flow sashimi, chawamushi and fresh seafood. Kiseki is the Singapore standard to what a good buffet deal should be about. They have an extensive list of Japanese cuisine that includes yakitori, tempura and teppanyaki too. Their dessert bar is pretty good too, hosting a variety of cakes, mochi and gelatos with interesting flavors like yuzu and wasabi \\u2013 Kiseki never disappoints. As a tip, make a reservation before you come or risk waiting an entire hour to get in. I have tried too many times hoping otherwise and ended up with the dreaded wait. Address: #08-01/02/03, Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road | Website| Opening hours: Daily 11:30 \\u2013 15:00 and 18:00 \\u2013 22:30 3. SUKI-YA I will be the first to say that SUKI-YA does not have an extensive selection. They have the right bases covered for a good Shabu Shabu \\u2013 enoki, oden, different vegetables like cabbage and carrots to flavor the soup. The prices here though are what really deserves a shout-out. On weekdays from 11.30am \\u2013 3pm, the 80 minutes buffet is as low as $14.90++ at I12 Katong Mall, and at $16.90++ at Plaza Singapura. Do note there\\u2019s an additional $3 fee on Fridays. Exclusively at I12 Katong mall, enjoy shabu shabu in a group of four and one dines free! They have many outlets strewn across Singapore. East to west, from Bukit Panjang, Plaza Sing, Bugis + to Tampines mall, SUKI-YA is the perfect place to arrange a catch up with friends over good old Shabu Shabu. The offers vary across different outlets, so do check out their promotions page for the most updated info. Address: Refer here for a list of all their other outlets 4. SSIKKEK Korean BBQ As per most Korean BBQs buffets in Singapore, you have a wide variety of meats with different cuts that range from pork collar, boneless chicken to marinated beef strips. A weekday lunch here is only at $14.90++. Their cooked menu is limited to a few dishes like sweet potato, Topoki and onion pancakes but it doesn\\u2019t bother me much though. When it comes down to kBBQ, I am only in it for the meat so the limited cooked menu is fine. They have 3 outlets in Singapore: United Square, Tanjong Pagar and Chinatown. They do not have a main website so you will have to google these individual outlets yourself. Also, check out their April promotion at the United Square outlet where weekend lunches are at $18/pax ++! Address: 101 Thomson Road, Singapore 307591 (United Square Outlet) | 6254 8123 | Opening Hours for Lunch: 11:30am ~ 2:30pm (Daily Except PH) for Dinner: Sun ~ Thur, PH : 5:30pm ~ 12am Fri, Sat, Day Before PH : 5:30pm ~ 2am 5. House of Steamboat Inside the store, there is a decent selection of yong tau fu items to choose from \\u2013 Taupok, meatballs, fishballs, fish maw etc. It is in my personal opinion that most steamboat food usually tastes the same anyway so I am not too picky about food. There is also an a la carte menu you order simple dishes like fried chicken drumlets, fried fish and mantous from. You can pay an extra $2 to have a grill for your food but I don\\u2019t find it necessary. I like to come here for weekend dinners with old friends over steamboat. At only $20nett per pax, you cannot find anything cheaper for a weekend buffet dinner. Don\\u2019t dress too nice if you\\u2019re paying the place a visit, everyone works up a little sweat during steamboat. Address: 7 Tan Quee Lan St, Singapore 188096 | Tel number: +65 63362875 | Open daily from 12pm \\u2013 12am 6. Shabu Sai Photo: sgfoodonfoot.com Shabu Sai has seasonal soup broths from time to time. Like their Yuzu salt beauty \\u2018collagen\\u2019 soup in july last year. I always fall back on the Tonkotsu soup base anyway, it\\u2019s a safer option. They serve the usual Shabu Shabu, 3 meats with a healthy array of vegetables, sushi and ice-cream on the side for dessert. With 6 outlets throughout Singapore mainly in central (Clarke Quay, Orchard Central,Suntec City) and the east (Changi City point, Eastpoint) with one outlet in the north (Causeway point), I recommend coming here for lunch on weekdays ($16.50++). The place still hits below the budget at $18.50++ on weekends too though. Address: 181 Orchard Road, 08-09/10/11 Orchard Central, Singapore 238896 | Opening hours: Mon \\u2013 Fri: 11:00 \\u2013 15:00 and 18:00 \\u2013 22:00 Sat \\u2013 Sun: 11:30 \\u2013 22:30 | Refer here for a full list of their other outlets mentioned earlier 7. Swensens Dessert Buffet (ION Orchard) Photo: beverlys.com Free flow waffles with brownies and cakes to pair with over 50 different ce cream types of your choice. The buffet runs 7 days a week and is exclusive to their Ion Orchard outlet. It does not come cheap though with the extended variety, the buffet is priced at $18.90 per pax. $12.90 if you get a main course separately before that. I recommend this place only for the dessert junkie because only those with a sweet tooth can appreciate what they have here free flow. No where else can you get such an extensive range of gelato and ice cream with 40 types of toppings and a mix-in service too.

Kim Korean Zubir A stone\\u2019s throw away from SOTA, the place is ridiculously priced at only $14++ on weekday lunches. Students have it even better with a special price at $12.90. At prices like these, I dare say it is one of the cheapest kBBQs in Singapore. As per most Korean BBQ places, Kim Korean Zubir has the standard meat cuts with a cooked selection a tad bit more than Sikeiski. Dishes like fried chicken, ginseng soup, nuggets as a lead up to the Korean meats. There is only one drawback though, the place lacks smoke chimneys so you will stink a bit after the meal but at these prices I honestly could not care less.

Lao Beijing Photo: springtomorrow.com While this buffet might be on the cheaper end ($13.99/pax during weekday High Tea) , the one caveat to it is the awkward eating timing from 3 \\u2013 5pm. Have a heavy brunch before coming to Lao Beijing for your high tea. In the restaurant itself, a few simple dishes like fried noodles, custard buns (sadly not the runny type), siumai are laid out on the side. The good stuff like the XLB, guotie, jiaozi are mostly on the paper menu. Its made this way so the dishes will always be served piping hot to customers. One of the cheapest deals in town, the limited variety of food items is very well worth overlooking for \\u2013 What more can you ask for free flow XLBs at prices like these?

Ban Heng Harborfront center Source: sparklette.com Compared to Lao Beijing, the variety dim-sum wise is a lot more extensive. Of course, it is priced proportionally more too. At $19.30++ per pax, the buffet runs from 11.30am \\u2013 2.30pm everyday. They have the usual dim sum essentials like har-gow, prawn rolls, shrimp dumplings etc but as a disclaimer \\u2013 no egg tarts. The service here can be rather slow so try to order as many dishes as you can each time you send one order in. Do not make intermittent orders where you may have your order missed out. Sadly, this dim sum buffet is also only exclusive to their Harbourfront outlet. It\\u2019s available on weekends too so I wouldn\\u2019t mind making my way down for some good old (cheap) dim sum. Note that it\\u2019s minimum of 4pax to enjoy the buffet.

Crystal Cafe Credit A lesser known porridge buffet compared to Quality Cafe, Crystal Cafe deserves some attention too. Considering the spread of dishes available including pastries and desserts, coffee and tea, the prices are pretty damn affordable. Their Sweet Potato Porridge has received quite some praise.

K.Cook Korean BBQ Conveniently located in town with a view overlooking orchard and yet at a crazy affordable price. When I go for Korean BBQ, the smell of the place tends to overwhelm me sometimes but at K.Cook, the place is spacious, with high ceilings and a big ass fan hence I assume the ventilation would be good. Apart from the standard BBQ fare, they also offer cooked Korean dishes like Japchae, Pancake and Spicy Tofu Stew. To top this off with a cherry, you\\u2019d be happy to know that canned drinks and condiments are free flow. You can literally feast till you conceive a food baby.

The prices here mostly do not include GST/service charge, so the total fee per pax might/will go above twenty dollars depending on the number of people you bring.This article works best to let you know exactly when and where to go to stretch your dollar. Stop wasting your money on overpriced buffets that just aren\\u2019t worth it. If you have a craving and you want to satisfy it endlessly with just that without thinking about the price tag. You have come to the right place. From Korean BBQs, Shabu Shabu to Dimsum budget buffets \\u2013 In the words of Taylor Swift, \\u201cI could show you incredible things.\\u201d 1. Little Ice Cream Kafe (LICK) The ice cream buffet here runs only on fridays from 2 \\u2013 4pm and 6 \\u2013 8pm. You are entitled to as many waffles as you would like with your gelato inclusive of toppings. The buffet procedure is rather simple; queue behind the counter and pick which flavors of ice cream you would like. Help yourself to the waffles at the side. I recommend the Avocado gelato, they capture the natural buttery flavor perfectly without it being too sweet. Something most half-baked ice cream cafes compensate by drowning their ice cream with Gula Melaka. Pffft. Try their Kaya Ice cream here too, something I bet you\\u2019ve never seen anywhere else. Address: 258 Tanjong Katong Road | http://lick.com.sg | Opening hours: Sun \\u2013 Thu: 13:00 \\u2013 23:00 Fri \\u2013 Sat: 11:00 \\u2013 00:00 2. KISEKI $19.80++ for weekday lunches for free flow sashimi, chawamushi and fresh seafood. Kiseki is the Singapore standard to what a good buffet deal should be about. They have an extensive list of Japanese cuisine that includes yakitori, tempura and teppanyaki too. Their dessert bar is pretty good too, hosting a variety of cakes, mochi and gelatos with interesting flavors like yuzu and wasabi \\u2013 Kiseki never disappoints. As a tip, make a reservation before you come or risk waiting an entire hour to get in. I have tried too many times hoping otherwise and ended up with the dreaded wait. Address: #08-01/02/03, Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road | Website| Opening hours: Daily 11:30 \\u2013 15:00 and 18:00 \\u2013 22:30 3. SUKI-YA I will be the first to say that SUKI-YA does not have an extensive selection. They have the right bases covered for a good Shabu Shabu \\u2013 enoki, oden, different vegetables like cabbage and carrots to flavor the soup. The prices here though are what really deserves a shout-out. On weekdays from 11.30am \\u2013 3pm, the 80 minutes buffet is as low as $14.90++ at I12 Katong Mall, and at $16.90++ at Plaza Singapura. Do note there\\u2019s an additional $3 fee on Fridays. Exclusively at I12 Katong mall, enjoy shabu shabu in a group of four and one dines free! They have many outlets strewn across Singapore. East to west, from Bukit Panjang, Plaza Sing, Bugis + to Tampines mall, SUKI-YA is the perfect place to arrange a catch up with friends over good old Shabu Shabu. The offers vary across different outlets, so do check out their promotions page for the most updated info. Address: Refer here for a list of all their other outlets 4. SSIKKEK Korean BBQ As per most Korean BBQs buffets in Singapore, you have a wide variety of meats with different cuts that range from pork collar, boneless chicken to marinated beef strips. A weekday lunch here is only at $14.90++. Their cooked menu is limited to a few dishes like sweet potato, Topoki and onion pancakes but it doesn\\u2019t bother me much though. When it comes down to kBBQ, I am only in it for the meat so the limited cooked menu is fine. They have 3 outlets in Singapore: United Square, Tanjong Pagar and Chinatown. They do not have a main website so you will have to google these individual outlets yourself. Also, check out their April promotion at the United Square outlet where weekend lunches are at $18/pax ++! Address: 101 Thomson Road, Singapore 307591 (United Square Outlet) | 6254 8123 | Opening Hours for Lunch: 11:30am ~ 2:30pm (Daily Except PH) for Dinner: Sun ~ Thur, PH : 5:30pm ~ 12am Fri, Sat, Day Before PH : 5:30pm ~ 2am 5. House of Steamboat Inside the store, there is a decent selection of yong tau fu items to choose from \\u2013 Taupok, meatballs, fishballs, fish maw etc. It is in my personal opinion that most steamboat food usually tastes the same anyway so I am not too picky about food. There is also an a la carte menu you order simple dishes like fried chicken drumlets, fried fish and mantous from. You can pay an extra $2 to have a grill for your food but I don\\u2019t find it necessary. I like to come here for weekend dinners with old friends over steamboat. At only $20nett per pax, you cannot find anything cheaper for a weekend buffet dinner. Don\\u2019t dress too nice if you\\u2019re paying the place a visit, everyone works up a little sweat during steamboat. Address: 7 Tan Quee Lan St, Singapore 188096 | Tel number: +65 63362875 | Open daily from 12pm \\u2013 12am 6. Shabu Sai Photo: sgfoodonfoot.com Shabu Sai has seasonal soup broths from time to time. Like their Yuzu salt beauty \\u2018collagen\\u2019 soup in july last year. I always fall back on the Tonkotsu soup base anyway, it\\u2019s a safer option. They serve the usual Shabu Shabu, 3 meats with a healthy array of vegetables, sushi and ice-cream on the side for dessert. With 6 outlets throughout Singapore mainly in central (Clarke Quay, Orchard Central,Suntec City) and the east (Changi City point, Eastpoint) with one outlet in the north (Causeway point), I recommend coming here for lunch on weekdays ($16.50++). The place still hits below the budget at $18.50++ on weekends too though. Address: 181 Orchard Road, 08-09/10/11 Orchard Central, Singapore 238896 | Opening hours: Mon \\u2013 Fri: 11:00 \\u2013 15:00 and 18:00 \\u2013 22:00 Sat \\u2013 Sun: 11:30 \\u2013 22:30 | Refer here for a full list of their other outlets mentioned earlier 7. Swensens Dessert Buffet (ION Orchard) Photo: beverlys.com Free flow waffles with brownies and cakes to pair with over 50 different ce cream types of your choice. The buffet runs 7 days a week and is exclusive to their Ion Orchard outlet. It does not come cheap though with the extended variety, the buffet is priced at $18.90 per pax. $12.90 if you get a main course separately before that. I recommend this place only for the dessert junkie because only those with a sweet tooth can appreciate what they have here free flow. No where else can you get such an extensive range of gelato and ice cream with 40 types of toppings and a mix-in service too. Forget that silly Marble Slab Groupon deal, Swensen\\u2019s dessert buffet is the real deal.

Lao Beijing Photo: springtomorrow.com While this buffet might be on the cheaper end ($13.99/pax during weekday High Tea) , the one caveat to it is the awkward eating timing from 3 \\u2013 5pm. Have a heavy brunch before coming to Lao Beijing for your high tea. In the restaurant itself, a few simple dishes like fried noodles, custard buns (sadly not the runny type), siumai are laid out on the side. The good stuff like the XLB, guotie, jiaozi are mostly on the paper menu. Its made this way so the dishes will always be served piping hot to customers. One of the cheapest deals in town, the limited variety of food items is very well worth overlooking for \\u2013 What more can you ask for free flow XLBs at prices like these?

They have the usual dim sum essentials like har-gow, prawn rolls, shrimp dumplings etc but as a disclaimer \\u2013 no egg tarts.

K.Cook Korean BBQ Conveniently located in town with a view overlooking orchard and yet at a crazy affordable price.

The prices here mostly do not include GST/service charge, so the total fee per pax might/will go above twenty dollars depending on the number of people you bring.This article works best to let you know exactly when and where to go to stretch your dollar. Stop wasting your money on overpriced buffets that just aren\\u2019t worth it. If you have a craving and you want to satisfy it endlessly with just that without thinking about the price tag. You have come to the right place. From Korean BBQs, Shabu Shabu to Dimsum budget buffets \\u2013 In the words of Taylor Swift, \\u201cI could show you incredible things.\\u201d 1. Little Ice Cream Kafe (LICK) The ice cream buffet here runs only on fridays from 2 \\u2013 4pm and 6 \\u2013 8pm. You are entitled to as many waffles as you would like with your gelato inclusive of toppings. The buffet procedure is rather simple; queue behind the counter and pick which flavors of ice cream you would like. Help yourself to the waffles at the side. I recommend the Avocado gelato, they capture the natural buttery flavor perfectly without it being too sweet. Something most half-baked ice cream cafes compensate by drowning their ice cream with Gula Melaka. Pffft. Try their Kaya Ice cream here too, something I bet you\\u2019ve never seen anywhere else. Address: 258 Tanjong Katong Road | http://lick.com.sg | Opening hours: Sun \\u2013 Thu: 13:00 \\u2013 23:00 Fri \\u2013 Sat: 11:00 \\u2013 00:00 2. KISEKI $19.80++ for weekday lunches for free flow sashimi, chawamushi and fresh seafood. Kiseki is the Singapore standard to what a good buffet deal should be about. They have an extensive list of Japanese cuisine that includes yakitori, tempura and teppanyaki too. Their dessert bar is pretty good too, hosting a variety of cakes, mochi and gelatos with interesting flavors like yuzu and wasabi \\u2013 Kiseki never disappoints. As a tip, make a reservation before you come or risk waiting an entire hour to get in. I have tried too many times hoping otherwise and ended up with the dreaded wait. Address: #08-01/02/03, Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road | Website| Opening hours: Daily 11:30 \\u2013 15:00 and 18:00 \\u2013 22:30 3. SUKI-YA I will be the first to say that SUKI-YA does not have an extensive selection. They have the right bases covered for a good Shabu Shabu \\u2013 enoki, oden, different vegetables like cabbage and carrots to flavor the soup. The prices here though are what really deserves a shout-out. On weekdays from 11.30am \\u2013 3pm, the 80 minutes buffet is as low as $14.90++ at I12 Katong Mall, and at $16.90++ at Plaza Singapura. Do note there\\u2019s an additional $3 fee on Fridays. Exclusively at I12 Katong mall, enjoy shabu shabu in a group of four and one dines free! They have many outlets strewn across Singapore. East to west, from Bukit Panjang, Plaza Sing, Bugis + to Tampines mall, SUKI-YA is the perfect place to arrange a catch up with friends over good old Shabu Shabu. The offers vary across different outlets, so do check out their promotions page for the most updated info. Address: Refer here for a list of all their other outlets 4. SSIKKEK Korean BBQ As per most Korean BBQs buffets in Singapore, you have a wide variety of meats with different cuts that range from pork collar, boneless chicken to marinated beef strips. A weekday lunch here is only at $14.90++. Their cooked menu is limited to a few dishes like sweet potato, Topoki and onion pancakes but it doesn\\u2019t bother me much though. When it comes down to kBBQ, I am only in it for the meat so the limited cooked menu is fine. They have 3 outlets in Singapore: United Square, Tanjong Pagar and Chinatown. They do not have a main website so you will have to google these individual outlets yourself. Also, check out their April promotion at the United Square outlet where weekend lunches are at $18/pax ++! Address: 101 Thomson Road, Singapore 307591 (United Square Outlet) | 6254 8123 | Opening Hours for Lunch: 11:30am ~ 2:30pm (Daily Except PH) for Dinner: Sun ~ Thur, PH : 5:30pm ~ 12am Fri, Sat, Day Before PH : 5:30pm ~ 2am 5. House of Steamboat Inside the store, there is a decent selection of yong tau fu items to choose from \\u2013 Taupok, meatballs, fishballs, fish maw etc. It is in my personal opinion that most steamboat food usually tastes the same anyway so I am not too picky about food. There is also an a la carte menu you order simple dishes like fried chicken drumlets, fried fish and mantous from. You can pay an extra $2 to have a grill for your food but I don\\u2019t find it necessary. I like to come here for weekend dinners with old friends over steamboat. At only $20nett per pax, you cannot find anything cheaper for a weekend buffet dinner. Don\\u2019t dress too nice if you\\u2019re paying the place a visit, everyone works up a little sweat during steamboat. Address: 7 Tan Quee Lan St, Singapore 188096 | Tel number: +65 63362875 | Open daily from 12pm \\u2013 12am 6. Shabu Sai Photo: sgfoodonfoot.com Shabu Sai has seasonal soup broths from time to time. Like their Yuzu salt beauty \\u2018collagen\\u2019 soup in july last year. I always fall back on the Tonkotsu soup base anyway, it\\u2019s a safer option. They serve the usual Shabu Shabu, 3 meats with a healthy array of vegetables, sushi and ice-cream on the side for dessert. With 6 outlets throughout Singapore mainly in central (Clarke Quay, Orchard Central,Suntec City) and the east (Changi City point, Eastpoint) with one outlet in the north (Causeway point), I recommend coming here for lunch on weekdays ($16.50++). The place still hits below the budget at $18.50++ on weekends too though. Address: 181 Orchard Road, 08-09/10/11 Orchard Central, Singapore 238896 | Opening hours: Mon \\u2013 Fri: 11:00 \\u2013 15:00 and 18:00 \\u2013 22:00 Sat \\u2013 Sun: 11:30 \\u2013 22:30 | Refer here for a full list of their other outlets mentioned earlier 7. Swensens Dessert Buffet (ION Orchard) Photo: beverlys.com Free flow waffles with brownies and cakes to pair with over 50 different ce cream types of your choice. The buffet runs 7 days a week and is exclusive to their Ion Orchard outlet. It does not come cheap though with the extended variety, the buffet is priced at $18.90 per pax. $12.90 if you get a main course separately before that. I recommend this place only for the dessert junkie because only those with a sweet tooth can appreciate what they have here free flow. No where else can you get such an extensive range of gelato and ice cream with 40 types of toppings and a mix-in service too. Forget that silly Marble Slab Groupon deal, Swensen\\u2019s dessert buffet is the real deal. Address: (Located inside Orchard Central) 2 Orchard Turn, #B1-31 | Tel: 68845967 | Opening hours: [Weekdays] 10.30am \\u2013 10.30pm [Weekends & PH] 8am-10.30pm 8. Kim Korean Zubir A stone\\u2019s throw away from SOTA, the place is ridiculously priced at only $14++ on weekday lunches. Students have it even better with a special price at $12.90. At prices like these, I dare say it is one of the cheapest kBBQs in Singapore. As per most Korean BBQ places, Kim Korean Zubir has the standard meat cuts with a cooked selection a tad bit more than Sikeiski. Dishes like fried chicken, ginseng soup, nuggets as a lead up to the Korean meats. There is only one drawback though, the place lacks smoke chimneys so you will stink a bit after the meal but at these prices I honestly could not care less. Address: School Of The Arts Singapore, 1 Zubir Said Drive #01-04/07 Singapore 227968 (Dhoby Ghaut) | Tel: 6238 7218 | Opening hours: Mon \\u2013 Fri: 11:30 \\u2013 14:30, Mon \\u2013 Fri: 17:00 \\u2013 23:00 and Sat \\u2013 Sun: 11:30 \\u2013 23:00 9. Lao Beijing Photo: springtomorrow.com While this buffet might be on the cheaper end ($13.99/pax during weekday High Tea) , the one caveat to it is the awkward eating timing from 3 \\u2013 5pm. Have a heavy brunch before coming to Lao Beijing for your high tea. In the restaurant itself, a few simple dishes like fried noodles, custard buns (sadly not the runny type), siumai are laid out on the side. The good stuff like the XLB, guotie, jiaozi are mostly on the paper menu. Its made this way so the dishes will always be served piping hot to customers. One of the cheapest deals in town, the limited variety of food items is very well worth overlooking for \\u2013 What more can you ask for free flow XLBs at prices like these?

Ban Heng Harborfront center Source: sparklette.com Compared to Lao Beijing, the variety dim-sum wise is a lot more extensive. Of course, it is priced proportionally more too. At $19.30++ per pax, the buffet runs from 11.30am \\u2013 2.30pm everyday. They have the usual dim sum essentials like har-gow, prawn rolls, shrimp dumplings etc but as a disclaimer \\u2013 no egg tarts. The service here can be rather slow so try to order as many dishes as you can each time you send one order in. Do not make intermittent orders where you may have your order missed out. Sadly, this dim sum buffet is also only exclusive to their Harbourfront outlet. It\\u2019s available on weekends too so I wouldn\\u2019t mind making my way down for some good old (cheap) dim sum. Note that it\\u2019s minimum of 4pax to enjoy the buffet. Address: 1 Maritime Square #04-01 HarbourFront Centre Singapore 099253 | http://www.banheng.com.sg/habourfront-center/ | Opening hours: Lunch \\u2013 11:30am \\u2013 2:30pm Dinner \\u2013 6:00pm \\u2013 10:00pm 11. King\\u2019s Laksa Steamboat Credit True to its name, this restaurant offers a wide enough variety of food befitting of a king\\u2019s feast. Unbelievable? I know. This restaurant boasts an array of over 80 steamboat ingredients that pairs wonderfully with their two soup bases; Laksa and Mala. In addition, the restaurant is situated in Serangoon that\\u2019s slightly detached from the general hustle and bustle of Central Singapore. Which ultimately makes it an ideal place to relax and hang out with your buddies. Lunch: Mon-Fri steamboat buffet lunch $21.80++ per pax, from 11am \\u2013 2.59pm King\\u2019s Laksa Steamboat: 17 Teck Chye Terrace, Singapore 545724 | Tel: +65 62878010 | Website 12. Chili Padi Nonya Cafe Credit If you\\u2019ve got a carving for Peranakan cuisine, the buffet offered by Chili Padi Nonya Cafe is as authentic as it gets around here. Its buffet lunch is priced at ($18.80) available from Monday to Friday from 11.15am \\u2013 3pm and Buffet Hi-Tea at a ridiculously low price of ($12.80) available only on Weekends and Public Holidays from 3pm \\u2013 5.15pm.

You have come to the right place. From Korean BBQs, Shabu Shabu to Dimsum budget buffets \\u2013 In the words of Taylor Swift, \\u201cI could show you incredible things.\\u201d 1. Little Ice Cream Kafe (LICK) The ice cream buffet here runs only on fridays from 2 \\u2013 4pm and 6 \\u2013 8pm. You are entitled to as many waffles as you would like with your gelato inclusive of toppings. The buffet procedure is rather simple; queue behind the counter and pick which flavors of ice cream you would like. Help yourself to the waffles at the side. I recommend the Avocado gelato, they capture the natural buttery flavor perfectly without it being too sweet. Something most half-baked ice cream cafes compensate by drowning their ice cream with Gula Melaka. Pffft. Try their Kaya Ice cream here too, something I bet you\\u2019ve never seen anywhere else. Address: 258 Tanjong Katong Road | http://lick.com.sg | Opening hours: Sun \\u2013 Thu: 13:00 \\u2013 23:00 Fri \\u2013 Sat: 11:00 \\u2013 00:00 2. KISEKI $19.80++ for weekday lunches for free flow sashimi, chawamushi and fresh seafood. Kiseki is the Singapore standard to what a good buffet deal should be about. They have an extensive list of Japanese cuisine that includes yakitori, tempura and teppanyaki too. Their dessert bar is pretty good too, hosting a variety of cakes, mochi and gelatos with interesting flavors like yuzu and wasabi \\u2013 Kiseki never disappoints. As a tip, make a reservation before you come or risk waiting an entire hour to get in. I have tried too many times hoping otherwise and ended up with the dreaded wait. Address: #08-01/02/03, Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road | Website| Opening hours: Daily 11:30 \\u2013 15:00 and 18:00 \\u2013 22:30 3. SUKI-YA I will be the first to say that SUKI-YA does not have an extensive selection. They have the right bases covered for a good Shabu Shabu \\u2013 enoki, oden, different vegetables like cabbage and carrots to flavor the soup. The prices here though are what really deserves a shout-out. On weekdays from 11.30am \\u2013 3pm, the 80 minutes buffet is as low as $14.90++ at I12 Katong Mall, and at $16.90++ at Plaza Singapura. Do note there\\u2019s an additional $3 fee on Fridays. Exclusively at I12 Katong mall, enjoy shabu shabu in a group of four and one dines free! They have many outlets strewn across Singapore. East to west, from Bukit Panjang, Plaza Sing, Bugis + to Tampines mall, SUKI-YA is the perfect place to arrange a catch up with friends over good old Shabu Shabu. The offers vary across different outlets, so do check out their promotions page for the most updated info. Address: Refer here for a list of all their other outlets 4. SSIKKEK Korean BBQ As per most Korean BBQs buffets in Singapore, you have a wide variety of meats with different cuts that range from pork collar, boneless chicken to marinated beef strips. A weekday lunch here is only at $14.90++. Their cooked menu is limited to a few dishes like sweet potato, Topoki and onion pancakes but it doesn\\u2019t bother me much though. When it comes down to kBBQ, I am only in it for the meat so the limited cooked menu is fine. They have 3 outlets in Singapore: United Square, Tanjong Pagar and Chinatown. They do not have a main website so you will have to google these individual outlets yourself. Also, check out their April promotion at the United Square outlet where weekend lunches are at $18/pax ++! Address: 101 Thomson Road, Singapore 307591 (United Square Outlet) | 6254 8123 | Opening Hours for Lunch: 11:30am ~ 2:30pm (Daily Except PH) for Dinner: Sun ~ Thur, PH : 5:30pm ~ 12am Fri, Sat, Day Before PH : 5:30pm ~ 2am 5. House of Steamboat Inside the store, there is a decent selection of yong tau fu items to choose from \\u2013 Taupok, meatballs, fishballs, fish maw etc. It is in my personal opinion that most steamboat food usually tastes the same anyway so I am not too picky about food. There is also an a la carte menu you order simple dishes like fried chicken drumlets, fried fish and mantous from. You can pay an extra $2 to have a grill for your food but I don\\u2019t find it necessary. I like to come here for weekend dinners with old friends over steamboat. At only $20nett per pax, you cannot find anything cheaper for a weekend buffet dinner. Don\\u2019t dress too nice if you\\u2019re paying the place a visit, everyone works up a little sweat during steamboat. Address: 7 Tan Quee Lan St, Singapore 188096 | Tel number: +65 63362875 | Open daily from 12pm \\u2013 12am 6. Shabu Sai Photo: sgfoodonfoot.com Shabu Sai has seasonal soup broths from time to time. Like their Yuzu salt beauty \\u2018collagen\\u2019 soup in july last year. I always fall back on the Tonkotsu soup base anyway, it\\u2019s a safer option. They serve the usual Shabu Shabu, 3 meats with a healthy array of vegetables, sushi and ice-cream on the side for dessert. With 6 outlets throughout Singapore mainly in central (Clarke Quay, Orchard Central,Suntec City) and the east (Changi City point, Eastpoint) with one outlet in the north (Causeway point), I recommend coming here for lunch on weekdays ($16.50++). The place still hits below the budget at $18.50++ on weekends too though. Address: 181 Orchard Road, 08-09/10/11 Orchard Central, Singapore 238896 | Opening hours: Mon \\u2013 Fri: 11:00 \\u2013 15:00 and 18:00 \\u2013 22:00 Sat \\u2013 Sun: 11:30 \\u2013 22:30 | Refer here for a full list of their other outlets mentioned earlier 7. Swensens Dessert Buffet (ION Orchard) Photo: beverlys.com Free flow waffles with brownies and cakes to pair with over 50 different ce cream types of your choice. The buffet runs 7 days a week and is exclusive to their Ion Orchard outlet. It does not come cheap though with the extended variety, the buffet is priced at $18.90 per pax. $12.90 if you get a main course separately before that. I recommend this place only for the dessert junkie because only those with a sweet tooth can appreciate what they have here free flow. No where else can you get such an extensive range of gelato and ice cream with 40 types of toppings and a mix-in service too. Forget that silly Marble Slab Groupon deal, Swensen\\u2019s dessert buffet is the real deal. Address: (Located inside Orchard Central) 2 Orchard Turn, #B1-31 | Tel: 68845967 | Opening hours: [Weekdays] 10.30am \\u2013 10.30pm [Weekends & PH] 8am-10.30pm 8. Kim Korean Zubir A stone\\u2019s throw away from SOTA, the place is ridiculously priced at only $14++ on weekday lunches. Students have it even better with a special price at $12.90. At prices like these, I dare say it is one of the cheapest kBBQs in Singapore. As per most Korean BBQ places, Kim Korean Zubir has the standard meat cuts with a cooked selection a tad bit more than Sikeiski. Dishes like fried chicken, ginseng soup, nuggets as a lead up to the Korean meats. There is only one drawback though, the place lacks smoke chimneys so you will stink a bit after the meal but at these prices I honestly could not care less. Address: School Of The Arts Singapore, 1 Zubir Said Drive #01-04/07 Singapore 227968 (Dhoby Ghaut) | Tel: 6238 7218 | Opening hours: Mon \\u2013 Fri: 11:30 \\u2013 14:30, Mon \\u2013 Fri: 17:00 \\u2013 23:00 and Sat \\u2013 Sun: 11:30 \\u2013 23:00 9. Lao Beijing Photo: springtomorrow.com While this buffet might be on the cheaper end ($13.99/pax during weekday High Tea) , the one caveat to it is the awkward eating timing from 3 \\u2013 5pm. Have a heavy brunch before coming to Lao Beijing for your high tea. In the restaurant itself, a few simple dishes like fried noodles, custard buns (sadly not the runny type), siumai are laid out on the side. The good stuff like the XLB, guotie, jiaozi are mostly on the paper menu. Its made this way so the dishes will always be served piping hot to customers. One of the cheapest deals in town, the limited variety of food items is very well worth overlooking for \\u2013 What more can you ask for free flow XLBs at prices like these?

Ban Heng Harborfront center Source: sparklette.com Compared to Lao Beijing, the variety dim-sum wise is a lot more extensive. Of course, it is priced proportionally more too. At $19.30++ per pax, the buffet runs from 11.30am \\u2013 2.30pm everyday. They have the usual dim sum essentials like har-gow, prawn rolls, shrimp dumplings etc but as a disclaimer \\u2013 no egg tarts. The service here can be rather slow so try to order as many dishes as you can each time you send one order in. Do not make intermittent orders where you may have your order missed out. Sadly, this dim sum buffet is also only exclusive to their Harbourfront outlet. It\\u2019s available on weekends too so I wouldn\\u2019t mind making my way down for some good old (cheap) dim sum. Note that it\\u2019s minimum of 4pax to enjoy the buffet. Address: 1 Maritime Square #04-01 HarbourFront Centre Singapore 099253 | http://www.banheng.com.sg/habourfront-center/ | Opening hours: Lunch \\u2013 11:30am \\u2013 2:30pm Dinner \\u2013 6:00pm \\u2013 10:00pm 11. King\\u2019s Laksa Steamboat Credit True to its name, this restaurant offers a wide enough variety of food befitting of a king\\u2019s feast. Unbelievable? I know. This restaurant boasts an array of over 80 steamboat ingredients that pairs wonderfully with their two soup bases; Laksa and Mala. In addition, the restaurant is situated in Serangoon that\\u2019s slightly detached from the general hustle and bustle of Central Singapore. Which ultimately makes it an ideal place to relax and hang out with your buddies. Lunch: Mon-Fri steamboat buffet lunch $21.80++ per pax, from 11am \\u2013 2.59pm King\\u2019s Laksa Steamboat: 17 Teck Chye Terrace, Singapore 545724 | Tel: +65 62878010 | Website 12.

Its buffet lunch is priced at ($18.80) available from Monday to Friday from 11.15am \\u2013 3pm and Buffet Hi-Tea at a ridiculously low price of ($12.80) available only on Weekends and Public Holidays from 3pm \\u2013 5.15pm. Dive back into Singapore\\u2019s heritage with traditional Nonya cuisine such as Braised Nonya Chap Chye, Itek Sio, Ayam Bua Kuluak and not to mention their wealth of pastries as well!

Al Jasra Restaurant / Kasi Villa Probably the cheapest Prata buffet around right now at only $6.90/person for 16 different prata flavours at Kasi Villa.

Crystal Cafe Credit A lesser known porridge buffet compared to Quality Cafe, Crystal Cafe deserves some attention too. Considering the spread of dishes available including pastries and desserts, coffee and tea, the prices are pretty damn affordable. Their Sweet Potato Porridge has received quite some praise. Mon-Thurs(Lunch &Dinner), Friday (Lunch): $14.80++ Friday (Dinner), Sat-Sun, PH & PH eve: $16.80++ Lunch hours: 12PM-2:30PM, Dinner: 6-10PM Orchard Grand Court, 131 Killiney Road, Singapore 239571 | Tel: 68302020 | Website 16. K.Cook Korean BBQ Conveniently located in town with a view overlooking orchard and yet at a crazy affordable price. When I go for Korean BBQ, the smell of the place tends to overwhelm me sometimes but at K.Cook, the place is spacious, with high ceilings and a big ass fan hence I assume the ventilation would be good. Apart from the standard BBQ fare, they also offer cooked Korean dishes like Japchae, Pancake and Spicy Tofu Stew. To top this off with a cherry, you\\u2019d be happy to know that canned drinks and condiments are free flow. You can literally feast till you conceive a food baby.

Crystal Cafe Credit A lesser known porridge buffet compared to Quality Cafe, Crystal Cafe deserves some attention too. Considering the spread of dishes available including pastries and desserts, coffee and tea, the prices are pretty damn affordable. Their Sweet Potato Porridge has received quite some praise.

K.Cook Korean BBQ Conveniently located in town with a view overlooking orchard and yet at a crazy affordable price. When I go for Korean BBQ, the smell of the place tends to overwhelm me sometimes but at K.Cook, the place is spacious, with high ceilings and a big ass fan hence I assume the ventilation would be good. Apart from the standard BBQ fare, they also offer cooked Korean dishes like Japchae, Pancake and Spicy Tofu Stew. To top this off with a cherry, you\\u2019d be happy to know that canned drinks and condiments are free flow. You can literally feast till you conceive a food baby. K.Cook is part of our 15 best Korean BBQ Restaurants. For more information, check out our review of K.Cook Korean BBQ here.

Goro Goro Steamboat & Korean Buffet Credit Other than usual ingredients for hotpot, they have Korean dises as well like Korean Chicken Wings, tteobokki, jjapchae etc. They also have local foods like ngoh hiang, ee mee.

The prices here mostly do not include GST/service charge, so the total fee per pax might/will go above twenty dollars depending on the number of people you bring.This article works best to let you know exactly when and where to go to stretch your dollar. Stop wasting your money on overpriced buffets that just aren\\u2019t worth it. If you have a craving and you want to satisfy it endlessly with just that without thinking about the price tag. You have come to the right place. From Korean BBQs, Shabu Shabu to Dimsum budget buffets \\u2013 In the words of Taylor Swift, \\u201cI could show you incredible things.\\u201d 1. Little Ice Cream Kafe (LICK) The ice cream buffet here runs only on fridays from 2 \\u2013 4pm and 6 \\u2013 8pm. You are entitled to as many waffles as you would like with your gelato inclusive of toppings. The buffet procedure is rather simple; queue behind the counter and pick which flavors of ice cream you would like. Help yourself to the waffles at the side. I recommend the Avocado gelato, they capture the natural buttery flavor perfectly without it being too sweet. Something most half-baked ice cream cafes compensate by drowning their ice cream with Gula Melaka. Pffft. Try their Kaya Ice cream here too, something I bet you\\u2019ve never seen anywhere else. Address: 258 Tanjong Katong Road | http://lick.com.sg | Opening hours: Sun \\u2013 Thu: 13:00 \\u2013 23:00 Fri \\u2013 Sat: 11:00 \\u2013 00:00 2. KISEKI $19.80++ for weekday lunches for free flow sashimi, chawamushi and fresh seafood. Kiseki is the Singapore standard to what a good buffet deal should be about. They have an extensive list of Japanese cuisine that includes yakitori, tempura and teppanyaki too. Their dessert bar is pretty good too, hosting a variety of cakes, mochi and gelatos with interesting flavors like yuzu and wasabi \\u2013 Kiseki never disappoints. As a tip, make a reservation before you come or risk waiting an entire hour to get in. I have tried too many times hoping otherwise and ended up with the dreaded wait. Address: #08-01/02/03, Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road | Website| Opening hours: Daily 11:30 \\u2013 15:00 and 18:00 \\u2013 22:30 3. SUKI-YA I will be the first to say that SUKI-YA does not have an extensive selection. They have the right bases covered for a good Shabu Shabu \\u2013 enoki, oden, different vegetables like cabbage and carrots to flavor the soup. The prices here though are what really deserves a shout-out. On weekdays from 11.30am \\u2013 3pm, the 80 minutes buffet is as low as $14.90++ at I12 Katong Mall, and at $16.90++ at Plaza Singapura. Do note there\\u2019s an additional $3 fee on Fridays. Exclusively at I12 Katong mall, enjoy shabu shabu in a group of four and one dines free! They have many outlets strewn across Singapore. East to west, from Bukit Panjang, Plaza Sing, Bugis + to Tampines mall, SUKI-YA is the perfect place to arrange a catch up with friends over good old Shabu Shabu. The offers vary across different outlets, so do check out their promotions page for the most updated info. Address: Refer here for a list of all their other outlets 4. SSIKKEK Korean BBQ As per most Korean BBQs buffets in Singapore, you have a wide variety of meats with different cuts that range from pork collar, boneless chicken to marinated beef strips. A weekday lunch here is only at $14.90++. Their cooked menu is limited to a few dishes like sweet potato, Topoki and onion pancakes but it doesn\\u2019t bother me much though. When it comes down to kBBQ, I am only in it for the meat so the limited cooked menu is fine. They have 3 outlets in Singapore: United Square, Tanjong Pagar and Chinatown. They do not have a main website so you will have to google these individual outlets yourself. Also, check out their April promotion at the United Square outlet where weekend lunches are at $18/pax ++! Address: 101 Thomson Road, Singapore 307591 (United Square Outlet) | 6254 8123 | Opening Hours for Lunch: 11:30am ~ 2:30pm (Daily Except PH) for Dinner: Sun ~ Thur, PH : 5:30pm ~ 12am Fri, Sat, Day Before PH : 5:30pm ~ 2am 5. House of Steamboat Inside the store, there is a decent selection of yong tau fu items to choose from \\u2013 Taupok, meatballs, fishballs, fish maw etc. It is in my personal opinion that most steamboat food usually tastes the same anyway so I am not too picky about food. There is also an a la carte menu you order simple dishes like fried chicken drumlets, fried fish and mantous from. You can pay an extra $2 to have a grill for your food but I don\\u2019t find it necessary. I like to come here for weekend dinners with old friends over steamboat. At only $20nett per pax, you cannot find anything cheaper for a weekend buffet dinner. Don\\u2019t dress too nice if you\\u2019re paying the place a visit, everyone works up a little sweat during steamboat. Address: 7 Tan Quee Lan St, Singapore 188096 | Tel number: +65 63362875 | Open daily from 12pm \\u2013 12am 6. Shabu Sai Photo: sgfoodonfoot.com Shabu Sai has seasonal soup broths from time to time. Like their Yuzu salt beauty \\u2018collagen\\u2019 soup in july last year. I always fall back on the Tonkotsu soup base anyway, it\\u2019s a safer option. They serve the usual Shabu Shabu, 3 meats with a healthy array of vegetables, sushi and ice-cream on the side for dessert. With 6 outlets throughout Singapore mainly in central (Clarke Quay, Orchard Central,Suntec City) and the east (Changi City point, Eastpoint) with one outlet in the north (Causeway point), I recommend coming here for lunch on weekdays ($16.50++). The place still hits below the budget at $18.50++ on weekends too though. Address: 181 Orchard Road, 08-09/10/11 Orchard Central, Singapore 238896 | Opening hours: Mon \\u2013 Fri: 11:00 \\u2013 15:00 and 18:00 \\u2013 22:00 Sat \\u2013 Sun: 11:30 \\u2013 22:30 | Refer here for a full list of their other outlets mentioned earlier 7. Swensens Dessert Buffet (ION Orchard) Photo: beverlys.com Free flow waffles with brownies and cakes to pair with over 50 different ce cream types of your choice. The buffet runs 7 days a week and is exclusive to their Ion Orchard outlet. It does not come cheap though with the extended variety, the buffet is priced at $18.90 per pax. $12.90 if you get a main course separately before that. I recommend this place only for the dessert junkie because only those with a sweet tooth can appreciate what they have here free flow. No where else can you get such an extensive range of gelato and ice cream with 40 types of toppings and a mix-in service too. Forget that silly Marble Slab Groupon deal, Swensen\\u2019s dessert buffet is the real deal. Address: (Located inside Orchard Central) 2 Orchard Turn, #B1-31 | Tel: 68845967 | Opening hours: [Weekdays] 10.30am \\u2013 10.30pm [Weekends & PH] 8am-10.30pm 8. Kim Korean Zubir A stone\\u2019s throw away from SOTA, the place is ridiculously priced at only $14++ on weekday lunches. Students have it even better with a special price at $12.90. At prices like these, I dare say it is one of the cheapest kBBQs in Singapore. As per most Korean BBQ places, Kim Korean Zubir has the standard meat cuts with a cooked selection a tad bit more than Sikeiski. Dishes like fried chicken, ginseng soup, nuggets as a lead up to the Korean meats. There is only one drawback though, the place lacks smoke chimneys so you will stink a bit after the meal but at these prices I honestly could not care less. Address: School Of The Arts Singapore, 1 Zubir Said Drive #01-04/07 Singapore 227968 (Dhoby Ghaut) | Tel: 6238 7218 | Opening hours: Mon \\u2013 Fri: 11:30 \\u2013 14:30, Mon \\u2013 Fri: 17:00 \\u2013 23:00 and Sat \\u2013 Sun: 11:30 \\u2013 23:00 9. Lao Beijing Photo: springtomorrow.com While this buffet might be on the cheaper end ($13.99/pax during weekday High Tea) , the one caveat to it is the awkward eating timing from 3 \\u2013 5pm. Have a heavy brunch before coming to Lao Beijing for your high tea. In the restaurant itself, a few simple dishes like fried noodles, custard buns (sadly not the runny type), siumai are laid out on the side. The good stuff like the XLB, guotie, jiaozi are mostly on the paper menu. Its made this way so the dishes will always be served piping hot to customers. One of the cheapest deals in town, the limited variety of food items is very well worth overlooking for \\u2013 What more can you ask for free flow XLBs at prices like these?

Ban Heng Harborfront center Source: sparklette.com Compared to Lao Beijing, the variety dim-sum wise is a lot more extensive. Of course, it is priced proportionally more too. At $19.30++ per pax, the buffet runs from 11.30am \\u2013 2.30pm everyday. They have the usual dim sum essentials like har-gow, prawn rolls, shrimp dumplings etc but as a disclaimer \\u2013 no egg tarts. The service here can be rather slow so try to order as many dishes as you can each time you send one order in. Do not make intermittent orders where you may have your order missed out. Sadly, this dim sum buffet is also only exclusive to their Harbourfront outlet. It\\u2019s available on weekends too so I wouldn\\u2019t mind making my way down for some good old (cheap) dim sum. Note that it\\u2019s minimum of 4pax to enjoy the buffet. Address: 1 Maritime Square #04-01 HarbourFront Centre Singapore 099253 | http://www.banheng.com.sg/habourfront-center/ | Opening hours: Lunch \\u2013 11:30am \\u2013 2:30pm Dinner \\u2013 6:00pm \\u2013 10:00pm 11. King\\u2019s Laksa Steamboat Credit True to its name, this restaurant offers a wide enough variety of food befitting of a king\\u2019s feast. Unbelievable? I know. This restaurant boasts an array of over 80 steamboat ingredients that pairs wonderfully with their two soup bases; Laksa and Mala. In addition, the restaurant is situated in Serangoon that\\u2019s slightly detached from the general hustle and bustle of Central Singapore. Which ultimately makes it an ideal place to relax and hang out with your buddies. Lunch: Mon-Fri steamboat buffet lunch $21.80++ per pax, from 11am \\u2013 2.59pm King\\u2019s Laksa Steamboat: 17 Teck Chye Terrace, Singapore 545724 | Tel: +65 62878010 | Website 12. Chili Padi Nonya Cafe Credit If you\\u2019ve got a carving for Peranakan cuisine, the buffet offered by Chili Padi Nonya Cafe is as authentic as it gets around here. Its buffet lunch is priced at ($18.80) available from Monday to Friday from 11.15am \\u2013 3pm and Buffet Hi-Tea at a ridiculously low price of ($12.80) available only on Weekends and Public Holidays from 3pm \\u2013 5.15pm. Dive back into Singapore\\u2019s heritage with traditional Nonya cuisine such as Braised Nonya Chap Chye, Itek Sio, Ayam Bua Kuluak and not to mention their wealth of pastries as well!
